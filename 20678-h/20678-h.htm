<h3>WE START FOR THE WAR</h3>


<p>I, James Frisby of Fairlee, in the
county of Kent, on the eastern shore
of what was known in my youth as the
fair Province of Maryland, but now
the proud State of that name, growing
old in years, but hearty and hale withal,
though the blood courses not through
my veins as in the days of my youth,
sit on the great porch of Fairlee watching
the sails on the distant bay, where
its gleaming waters meet the mouth of
the creek that runs at the foot of Fairlee.
A julep there is on the table
beside me, flavoured with mint gathered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
by the hands of John Cotton early
in the morning, while the dew was still
upon it, from the finest bank in all
Kent County.</p>

<p>So with these old friends around me,
with the julep on my right hand and
the paper before me, I sit on the great
porch of Fairlee to write of the wild
days of my youth, when I first drew
my sword in the Great Cause. To
write, before my hand becomes feeble
and my eyes grow dim, of the strange
things that I saw and the adventures
that befell me, of the old Tory of the
Braes, of the fair maid his daughter,
and of the part they played in my life
during the War of the Deliverance.
To write so that those who come after
me, as well as those who are growing
up around my knees, may know the
part their grandfather played in the
stirring times that proclaimed the birth
of a mighty nation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>The first year of the great struggle,
ah, me! I was young then, and the
wild blood was in my veins. I was
broad of shoulder and long of limb,
with a hand that gripped like steel and
a seat in the saddle that was the envy
of all that hard-riding country. I was
hardy and skilled in all the outdoor
sports and pastimes of my race and
people, and being light in the saddle I
often led the hardest riders and won
from them the brush, while every creek
for fifty miles up and down the broad
Chesapeake, and even the farther shore
as far as Baltimore, knew my canoe,
and the High Sheriff himself was no
finer shot than I.</p>

<p>You, who bask in the sunshine of
long and dreary years of peace, who
never hear the note of the bugle nor
see the flash of the foeman's steel from
one year's end to another, know not
what it was to live in those stirring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
times and all the joy of the strife.
You should have seen us then, when
the whole land was aflame.</p>

<p>The fiery signal had come like a
rush of the wind from the north, with
the cry of the dying on the roadsides
and fields of Lexington.</p>

<p>All along the western shore the men
of Anne Arundel, of Frederick, and
Prince George were mustering fast and
strong. Then the Kentish men and
those of Queen Anne and all the lower
shore were mounting fast and mustering,
while from the Howard hills came
riding down bold and hardy yeomen.</p>

<p>Then, and as it has always been in
the old province of Maryland, the gentlemen
led the people, and everywhere
the spirit of fire ran like molten steel
through the veins of the gathering
hosts, and the people took up the
gauntlet of war with a laugh and a
cheer and shook their clenched hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
at the King who was over the sea; so
it was the length and breadth of the
province, and so it was with me.</p>

<p>And so one day the signal came, and
I mounted my black colt Toby and
rode away to the Head of Elk in the
county of Cecil, where the mustering
was, to take my place, as it was my
duty and right to do, side by side with
the bravest gentlemen of the province
in the coming struggle for the Great
Cause.</p>

<p>I was eighteen in the month of
March of that year and considered myself
a man, and, having reached man's
estate, I bade good-bye to my mother
and rode from out the sheltering walls
and groves of Fairlee.</p>

<p>But just before I rode within the
shadow of the great woods I turned in
my saddle and waved my hand to the
small, quaint figure that stood on the
broad porch watching me disappear;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and she bravely&mdash;for the women were
brave in those days&mdash;waved her hand
in return, and then I rode on, for the
moment saddened at the parting, for
the die that day would be cast, and,
though there would be mustering and
drilling for many weeks before we took
up our march to the northward, the
hand of the cause would claim me as
its own.</p>

<p>I was riding thus through the forest
when I heard hoof-beats behind me
and a cheery halloo, and who should
ride up but Dick Ringgold of Hunting
Field, a lad of my own age and my
true friend?</p>

<p>"Why such a long face?" he laughed.
"You look as if you were going to a
funeral and not to a hunt that will beat
all the runs to the hounds in the world.
We are going to hunt redcoats and fair
ladies' smiles and not foxes now; so
cheer up, man."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Plague on it, Dick, you are ten
miles from home and I am only one,"
I retorted. "You ought to have seen
how bravely her ladyship tried to smile,
too."</p>

<p>"We will increase the number of
miles then," said he, and reaching over
he struck Toby across the flank. Well,
Toby needs the curb at best, and it
was a full half-mile before I brought
him up and had a chance to give Dick
a rating.</p>

<p>But Dick only laughed.</p>

<p>And so we rode on, across the low-lying
plains of Kent, northward toward
the borders of Cecil.</p>

<p>For miles we would ride under the
shadow of the dense forest, and then
we would come to the wide-reaching
fields of some great manor or plantation,
the manor house itself generally
crowning some gently rising knoll amid
a grove of trees, with a view of the distant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
bay, or creek, or river, as the case
might be; the cluster of houses, the
quarters for the slaves, the stables and
the barns, making little villages and
hamlets amid the wide expanse of farm
lands and the distant circle of the dark
green forests.</p>

<p>Then, again, a creek or river would
bar our course, and we would have to
ride for miles until we turned its head,
or found a ferry or a ford, and so overcome
its opposition. So on we rode
until, as the day waxed near the noon
hour, we came to the little hamlet of
Georgetown, nestling amid the hills on
the banks of the Sassafras. Crossing
the river at the ferry, we began the last
stage of our journey.</p>

<p>The trail now skirted the broad lands
of Bohemia Manor, and crossed the
beautiful river of that name, embedded
between the hills and wide-stretching
farm lands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>As we approached the banks of the
Elk the country grew more rolling and
wilder&mdash;in our front the Iron Hills
rose up before us, crowned with forests,
in sharp contrast to the low-lying
country through which we had been
passing.</p>

<p>And now, as our appetites became
pressing, we urged our horses on, for
we had still many miles to travel.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>WE MEET THE MAID</h3>


<p>We had just come in sight of the
blue waters of the Elk, as it rolled
between the forest-clad hills on either
side, basking here for a moment in the
sunshine, then lost in the deeper shadows
of the overhanging forest.</p>

<p>"There rolls the Elk," cried Dick.
"Only ten miles more, and a stroke
upon a piece of paper, and then, my
boy, you are done for. A pain that
eats its way ever inward, a thirst that
never slackens, and over all the black
night lowering down. Aye, so it is,
Sir Monk of the Long Face; but we
will have some fun before we are put
under the sod or our bones are left to
whiten on the sands."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"That we will, Sir Richard. And
now we are in for it, for here comes
our first adventure. Is she ugly or is
she fair? Which, Sir Richard?"</p>

<p>For, as we reached the point where
our road joins the river road, we saw,
approaching along the lower road, a
gentleman riding on a powerful horse,
while behind him on a pillion sat a
slight girlish figure, hidden in part by
the broad shoulders of the rider.</p>

<p>"By Jove, it is Gordon of the
Braes," said Dick.</p>

<p>"What, the suspected Tory?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and that must be his daughter.
They say she is the fairest lass in all
the county of Cecil."</p>

<p>"Tory or no Tory," said I, "with
a fair face at stake, I will speak to
him."</p>

<p>They were as yet some distance off,
but as the rider drew nearer to us we
saw that he was a splendid specimen of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
manhood, such as I had but seldom
seen before.</p>

<p>While strong of frame and above the
medium height, he carried himself and
rode with a courtliness and ease that
bespoke the accomplished horseman
and gentleman. His splendid head
and face showed the marks of an
adventurous career, and all bespoke the
blood of the family from which he had
sprung, the Gordons of Avochie.</p>

<p>But striking as was the figure of the
rider, the glimpse we caught of the fair
burden behind made us for the moment
forget him.</p>

<p>A slender figure it was that sat upon
the pillion, with wonderful eyes of the
darkest blue and hair of the deepest
brown that waved and clustered around
the temples&mdash;a mouth that was winsome
and sweet, a small and aristocratic
nose, a chin that was slightly determined,
giving her altogether a queenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
air, as she sat so straight and prim
behind her father.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, making Toby advance
and bowing to his mane, "as we are
travelling the same way, will you permit
us to accompany you? My friend is
Richard Ringgold of Hunting Field
and I am James Frisby of Fairlee."</p>

<p>"It will give me pleasure," he
replied, saluting courteously, "to have
your company to the Head of Elk. I
know your families and your houses
well, and you, no doubt, have heard of
me, Charles Gordon of the Braes."</p>

<p>"That we have," said Dick Ringgold.
"It was only a week ago that
my mother spoke of your first coming
to old Kent."</p>

<p>"It was kind of her to remember
me," he replied. "She was a great
belle and a beauty in her youth."</p>

<p>Dick smiled with pleasure, and I,
taking advantage of a narrow place in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the road, fell behind, and rode so I
could talk to Mistress Jean, much to
Master Richard's secret indignation.
But she received me with a show of
displeasure, and though I courteously
asked her of her journey, it was some
minutes before I knew the cause thereof.</p>

<p>"Are you not," said she, and her
aristocratic little head was in the air,
"afraid to be seen riding with suspected
Tories, you who wear the black
cockade?"</p>

<p>And then I remembered that I wore
the emblem of our party.</p>

<p>"Afraid!" I replied. "Afraid! We
who have bearded the Ministers of
the Crown in the broad light of day?
Do you think I am afraid of our own
men? Why, if Mistress North herself
were half as fair as your ladyship of the
Braes, I would ride with her through
all the armies of the patriots, and no
man would dare say me nay."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>A merry twinkle came into her eyes.
"Would you wear the red cockade if
she should ask you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Mistress Jean, would you
seduce me from my allegiance to the
cause of the patriots?"</p>

<p>"To the cause of the patriots?
What of your allegiance to the King?"</p>

<p>"But the King himself has broken
that, and forced us in self-defence to
take up arms in revolt. Would you
have me true to my people, or to the
King, who is over the sea?"</p>

<p>"To the King," she answered
promptly, "for the King's Ministers
may be bad men to-day and good to-morrow,
but if you once strike a blow
at the mother country and win, then
the ties of love, of friendship, and of
interest are severed for ever."</p>

<p>"Yes; but she should have thought
of that before she forced us to it."</p>

<p>"What spoiled children you are,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
she cried. "Because the taffy is not as
good as usual you want to pull the
house down about our ears."</p>

<p>Thus receiving and parrying thrusts,
we rode along the banks of the Elk, and
as we neared the ferry we met numbers
of men travelling the same way with us,
all bound for the great mustering, and
though they returned our salutations,
seeing the black cockade in our hats,
they scowled on Gordon of the Braes.</p>

<p>"There goes that dog of a Tory," I
would hear them growl to one another
as we passed.</p>

<p>But Gordon rode on with a cool, indifferent,
almost contemptuous manner,
which made the frowns grow blacker,
and the mutterings deeper and louder.
But no man as yet sought to beard him,
for his courage and his daring were
well known throughout the shore, and
it would have taken a bold man indeed
to cross Gordon of the Braes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>At last we came to the ferry and saw
on the hillside, among the forest trees,
the white tents, already taking on the
appearance of a well-regulated camp.
The little town amid the trees, busy
with the life of the moving crowd, and
bright with the uniforms of the Maryland
Line, which we were soon to
don, formed a curious spectacle as we
entered.</p>

<p>Every part of the province was represented.
Here was a tall backwoodsman
in his coonskin cap, buckskin
shirt and leggings, with his long and
deadly rifle, totally unadorned by the
glint of silver or chasing on the barrel
to betray him to his redskin neighbour&mdash;and
you knew that one of Cresap's
riflemen was before you.</p>

<p>By his side, for the moment, was a
young tobacco planter from Prince
George. The youngster to whom he
was talking, clad in the scarlet and buff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of the Maryland Line, was a young
dandy from Annapolis.</p>

<p>And so it was all through the crowd,
the frontiersman, the hard-riding country
squire, and the city swell, all mingled
together, and all animated with one all-pervading
and all-engrossing thought&mdash;how
best to secure the freedom of
the country and resist the tyranny of
the King.</p>

<p>As we made our way through the
crowd the faces grew dark as they saw
the Tory, but as Dick and I rode on
either hand, with our black cockades,
the crowd murmuringly gave way before
us, and though all the people were
hostile to him, and he could not help
but see it, he coolly looked them over
and rode as if he had no enemy within
a hundred miles.</p>

<p>But the colour in Mistress Jean's
cheek flamed high, and I saw her little
hands clenched together, as if she would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
like to tell these rebels what she
thought of their treatment of her father.
And I, seeing the war signal so clearly
on her cheek, and daring not the batteries
of her eyes and wit, was discreet
and said not a word.</p>

<p>We took our way to the inn, kept
by one John McLean, a genial host
and Scotchman, who was well known
in three provinces, and kept the finest
inn for many miles around.</p>

<p>He received us in a jovial way, for
though he was a stanch patriot, he and
Gordon had been friends for many
years.</p>

<p>"So, Mistress Jean, you have
deigned to honour my roof with your
presence. Welcome, welcome, all of
you."</p>

<p>And though I had swung myself off
Toby to assist Mistress Jean to dismount,
he was before me and swung
her lightly to the ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I declare," he said, "you grow
bonnier every day, lassie," which
brought a blush to her cheek. Then,
turning, he called his wife and placed
Mistress Jean in her charge.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say, gentlemen, that
the inn is very crowded, as you see,
but I think I can find a place for
you." Then drawing the Tory aside
for a little way, we heard him remonstrating
with him for coming to the
town at such a time, when the feeling
ran so strong and high against the
Loyalist.</p>

<p>"You risk your life," he said, "for
the slightest spark or indiscretion will
bring a mob, boiling and seething
around you. The officers will not be
able to hold the men in, as they are
only volunteers, and have not yet felt
the hand of discipline."</p>

<p>But Charles Gordon shrugged his
shoulders, and his reply came distinct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and clear: "I thought you knew me
better, McLean. I would not hide my
head for a hundred or a thousand of
them;" and he turned and went into
the inn.</p>

<p>The innkeeper made a gesture of
despair. "That is always the way,"
said he, "both in this country and the
old; tell a Gordon of a danger and he
will rush right into it, and then expect
to come out safe and sound."</p>

<p>We laughed, for the expression on
the old Scotchman's face was so
droll.</p>

<p>"But now for your room, gentlemen;"
and he led the way to a small
room under the gable roof. "It is the
only room I have left," he said, "but
you are welcome to it."</p>

<p>It was now somewhat late in the
afternoon, but having made ourselves
presentable and partaken of a lunch, we
went to report ourselves to Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Ramsay of the 1st Regiment of the
Maryland Line.</p>

<p>He received us at his tent door with
a warm grasp of the hand. "You are
the very lads I have been waiting for,"
he said. "I have two Lieutenancies to
fill, and you are the men to fill
them."</p>

<p>"But, Captain," said Dick Ringgold,
"we have not been tried yet. Let us
go into the ranks and fight our way up,
as so many better men than we are
doing."</p>

<p>I could not help admiring Dick for
his modesty, and though I, too, said
the same thing, I confess I hoped the
Captain would not hear of it, and so it
proved.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, and patted Dick
on the shoulder. "I must have you;
I know the blood that runs in your
veins, lads, and that I will have no
better fighting stock in the army."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
And thus it was settled, and we became
officers in that Maryland Line,
and&mdash;I say it with all due modesty&mdash;the
most famous of all the fighting
regiments in the struggle for the Great
Cause.</p>

<h3>A FLASH OF STEEL</h3>


<p>That night we sat at the long table
in the dining-room of the inn. All up
and down its great length sat the officers
of the Line&mdash;country gentlemen from
Cecil, Kent, and as far south as Queen
Anne, who had ridden thus far to see
the mustering and to give it their countenance
and their favour. Grave and
sedate gentlemen many of them, men
of affairs, the leaders of their counties,
and delegates to the Convention and to
Congress&mdash;men of the oldest and
bluest blood in the province, of wide
estates and famous names, whose families
wielded a mighty influence in the
cause of the patriots and gave it stability
and great strength.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was the parson, a merry
old gentleman, stout of form, with a
round face and twinkling eyes, who in
his youth was a mighty fox-hunter in
spite of his cloth; even then, stout as
he had grown, when he heard the music
of the hounds, it was with difficulty he
restrained the inclination to follow,
which now, alas! was made impossible
by his great weight. We who loved
hard riding, hard fighting, and a strong
will, admired him, and no man was
more popular throughout the three
counties than the fox-hunting parson.
He knew the people and their ways,
and was one of them.</p>

<p>"I hear you are fire-eaters here," he
said to a vestryman upon being installed.</p>

<p>"Then we are well matched," came
the reply, "for they say you are a
pepperbox."</p>

<p>So no gathering throughout the
county was a success without the parson,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and by the unanimous voice of the
Line he was called to be their chaplain.</p>

<p>We sat there in the long dining-room
amid the hum of many voices, the glare
of many lights, and the click of the
glasses, as the wine was going around,
when a young man who sat across the
table from me rose with his glass poised
between his fingers.</p>

<p>He was a handsome man, of twenty-one
or twenty-two, of dark and swarthy
features, thick lips and nose, and hair as
black as night, telling of the Indian
blood in his veins.</p>

<p>His name was Rodolph, and he was
the son of a man more noted for his
wealth than for his principles, but who
was then at the city of Annapolis, a
delegate from the county of Cecil.</p>

<p>"I propose a toast," he cried, "that
all true patriots should drink. A
toast to the delegates of this county,
who at the convention of the province<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
in the city of Annapolis are standing
as the bulwarks of liberty against the
tyranny of the Crown."</p>

<p>We were all on our feet in an instant
to drink the toast, with a right goodwill,
all except Charles Gordon, who sat
at my right hand. He kept his seat
and watched us with a cool, sarcastic
smile upon his lips.</p>

<p>"Is not the toast good enough for
you?" cried Rodolph, with an ugly
sneer upon his face.</p>

<p>All eyes now turned to where Charles
Gordon sat, and he slowly rose.</p>

<p>"Drink to your delegates?" said he.
"Not I. They are the scum of the
county of Cecil, and you know it. I
would as soon be governed by my slaves
at the Braes as by such men as they are.
I wish you joy of them." And bowing,
he turned and left the room by a door
that was near at hand.</p>

<p>For an instant there was silence, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
an uproar broke forth, and Rodolph
sprang around the table to follow him,
with several of the young men at his
heels. But I, seeing the danger, with
possibly a thought of a fair maid's
eyes, threw myself before the door with
drawn sword.</p>

<p>"No man passes through this door,"
I cried, "unless he passes over me."</p>

<p>The crowd drew back in surprise.</p>

<p>"Since when," I shouted, for they
hesitated, "have Maryland gentlemen
learned to fight in mobs? If any one
has an insult to resent, let him fight as
becomes a gentleman, man to man."</p>

<p>"Stand aside," shouted Rodolph,
who was now before me, "and let me
get at the traitor."</p>

<p>"Put up your swords, gentlemen."
I found I had a new ally in a tall, dignified
gentleman, who took his place
beside me, a Mr. Wilmer of the White
House in Kent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"The lad is right," he said; "and
you, Rodolph, I should think, would
have had enough of Charles Gordon of
the Braes."</p>

<p>At this there was a laugh, which at
the time I did not understand; but the
company good-naturedly put back their
swords and resumed their places at the
table, all except Rodolph, who slipped
away from the room.</p>

<p>That night, as I lay upon my bed,
dreaming, boylike, of the fair eyes of
the Tory maid, and hoping that the
part I had played in the matter of the
toast might come to her ears and cause
her to give me a smile at our next meeting,
I heard the sound of footsteps coming
down the passageway.</p>

<p>"There is great danger," said a voice,
which I recognised as the landlord's,
as they were passing by my door.
"Rodolph is stirring up the crowd, and
though you might brave the mob,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Mistress Jean&mdash;" and then the voices
died away.</p>

<p>"The mob" and "Mistress Jean."
Clearly something must be afoot.
Springing from my bed, I swore to
myself, that, if anything happened to
the Tory maid, I would make Phil
Rodolph feel the edge of my sword.
Hastily throwing on my clothes, I went
to the window and looked out. The
night was dark, the sky being full of
drifting clouds, through which the moon
faintly struggled; everything lay quiet
and still in the village and the camp.
Steps were heard upon the porch below,
and then a horse was brought around
from the stables. A moment later a
horseman mounted, and I saw a slender
figure on the pillion behind him.</p>

<p>"Keep to the south road," said a
voice, "they have only one sentry
there."</p>

<p>I did not wait to hear more, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
slipped downstairs and out of a side
door, and the next moment I was running
softly through the camp to the
outpost on the south road, for one of
my own men was stationed there, and
I knew that without orders or the countersign
no man would pass that way
that night. It was well I did, for as I
drew near I heard the challenge "Who
goes there?" and the answer "A
friend."</p>

<p>"Advance, friend, and give the
countersign."</p>

<p>"Maryland." But the Tory had
missed it, and the next moment the
sentry's rifle was at his shoulder, and I
knew the cry for the officer of the guard
would follow; so I stepped out from
the shadow, and the sentry, seeing me,
brought his rifle to a salute.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," he said, "he wants to
pass, and has given the wrong countersign."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said I, drawing my hat over
my eyes, for I did not wish to be recognised
by Mistress Jean. "I heard.
But I know them; let them pass."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the rider, and a
still softer "Thank you" came from
his companion. I bowed, but said
nothing, and stood there watching them
disappear down the dark road until the
sound of the horse's hoofs was lost in
the distance.</p>

<p>"Queer time of the night to ride,
sir," said the sentinel.</p>

<p>"Yes; but they have far to go."</p>

<p>"Kent or Queen Anne's, sir?"</p>

<p>"Down by Bohemia Manor."</p>

<p>"That is where that old Tory Gordon
lives; they say they are going to rout
him out in the morning for insulting
the committee last night. He is
up at the inn, there, and Phil Rodolph
says he is going to make it hot for him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mere talk, I expect. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night, sir."</p>

<p>I took my way back to the inn, and
when I crawled to my room once more
and into bed, Dick Ringgold raised
himself on his arm and said in a sleepy
voice: "What's up, Frisby?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," I replied; "go to
sleep." And I soon followed my own
advice.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE RED COCKADE</h3>


<p>The stirring notes of the bugle made
us spring up in the morning, to find,
when we were again downstairs, that
every one was talking of the disappearance
of Charles Gordon of the Braes.</p>

<p>Master Richard marvelled much at
the disappearance of the Tory, and,
though I knew it was of the Tory maid
he was thinking, I said not a word,
but went on with my duties; and
manifold they were for many days to
come. The drilling of the raw recruits,
who, though they were full of fire and
<i>&eacute;lan</i>, were not used to the strict obedience
of orders, was at first very difficult.
But soon there came the spirit
and the pride that were to make them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the best drilled troops, the dandies and
macaronies of the army. And so, with
the drilling of recruits and assisting
Captain Ramsay in the formation of
the regiment, a week passed by before
a day came when Dick and I found
a few spare hours on our hands. And
having certain plans and purposes in
view, and not wishing them to be
known to Dick, I sat and watched for
an opportunity to slip away.</p>

<p>Master Richard, it was evident, had
also some plans on foot, for after moving
from the chair to the top of a box
and then back again, he stretched his
arms above his head, and, yawning,
said: "I believe I will take a little
canter down the south road; come
along?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied; "I am going to ride
a short distance down the east road."</p>

<p>"All right," said he, and springing
from his chair, he went to order his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
horse. I soon followed, and, having
seen Dick well on his way, rode for
a short distance on the east road,
then turned, rode back, and entered
the road which runs along the bank
of the Elk, by which we had entered
the town on our journey from Kent.
As I rode, I hummed a jovial hunting-song
and touched Toby with the spur,
for I was quite jubilant at having got
rid of Dick and so well on the road to
my adventure.</p>

<p>My time was short and it was good
twelve miles to the Braes, but Toby's
sire was a son of old Ranter, and I knew
he could do it in an hour and a half.
So Toby felt the spur, and I barely
noticed the miles as we flew along,
until we came to the road that leads
south to the Braes. Down this road
we turned, and as we were so near the
end of our journey I began to think
of the reasons and excuses I should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
give for my visit. Reason! Pshaw!
What better reason does a Marylander
want than a pair of blue eyes? And
if Mistress Jean should so much as
demand it by the merest glance of those
eyes, I would tell her so. Aye, but
she is a Tory and wears the red cockade.
True, but the fairer the enemy the
more difficult the prize, the greater the
glory and effort to win.</p>

<p>And so, having justified my invasion
of the stronghold of the Tory, I pricked
Toby with the spur and rode on more
rapidly, when, on turning a bend in
the road where it is intersected by
one from the east, whom should I come
face to face with but Master Richard?
For a moment he stared at me with
open mouth, and I at him; then his
brow grew dark.</p>

<p>"I thought," he cried; but suddenly
the humour of our meeting came over
him. Thrusting his hands into his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
pockets, he broke out into a hearty burst
of laughter, and I could do nothing but
follow.</p>

<p>"And so, Master Frisby, you rode
down the east road."</p>

<p>"And you, methinks, rode down
the south." Again our laughter rang
through the woods.</p>

<p>"Come," he cried, "which is it to
be? So fair a maid deserves two
cavaliers, but we would be at sword
points within a week, and I do not
wish to lose the friendship of Mr. James
Frisby of Fairlee."</p>

<p>"A chance has brought us here, so
let chance decide."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Dick, pulling out a
sovereign, and with a twitch of the
thumb, he sent it high in the air.
"Heads, you win. Tails, I win."
Then catching it as it fell: "By Jove,
you have it. Present my compliments
to Mistress Jean," he cried, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
grandiloquent bow, "and tell her how
near she came to being Mrs. Dick
Ringgold of Hunting Field."</p>

<p>"That I will, Sir Richard." But
Dick was gone, and I was left to ride
on to the Braes.</p>

<p>A long, rambling house it was, standing
white amid the trees, a wide lawn
around it stretching down to the creek
at its foot; while beyond could be seen
the sunlight gleaming on the bay. A
quaint, old-fashioned place, the low
roof already growing dark with age;
the quiet air of ease and comfort brooding
over all, making a fitting setting
for the quaint, slender little lady that
ruled its destinies.</p>

<p>A negro took my horse; another
showed me across the broad hall, with
its hunting whips and trophies on the
wall, to the parlour, and there I awaited
the coming of the Tory maid. And
as I sat there, gently stroking the toe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of my boot with my whip, and thinking
of that night at the inn, of that soft
"Thank you" on the old south road,
I heard the soft swish of her skirts,
and, looking up, saw Mistress Jean
standing in the doorway. A beautiful
picture it was, like some old portrait
of Lely's, the maid standing there
framed in the old oak. And I, though
I had been to the balls at the Governor's
house the winter before, and was therefore
a man of the world, sat staring for a
moment. But she advanced, and I was
on my feet with a low and sweeping bow.</p>

<p>"Father is away," said she, "but
in his name I wish to thank you for
defending us at the inn that night."</p>

<p>So she knew.</p>

<p>"It was to save the honour of Maryland
gentlemen," I replied modestly.
"Heretofore they have not fought in
mobs. But will you not thank me for
yourself?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"When you turn loyalist, yes," said
she.</p>

<p>"Almost thou persuadest me to
become a traitor."</p>

<p>"You are that already," she said
with spirit.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the way they have
written 'Patriot' since Tyranny first
stalked across the world. But patriot
or traitor, Mistress Jean, I have already
won one 'Thank you,' and I hope
some day to win another."</p>

<p>"Won one 'Thank you'&mdash;when
and where?" and she looked at me with
wide open eyes.</p>

<p>Now every Marylander will admit
that there are no more gallant fellows
in the world than we are, and if any
one chooses to dispute it, well and good,
we are willing to cross swords with him
any day, and so reprove him for his
recklessness. Indeed, we have been
called with truth the Gascons of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
South, and, like those gallant gentlemen
of old France, we have never hidden our
light under a bushel, to use a homely
phrase; and so when I saw Mistress
Jean's air of surprise, the spirit of my
race came over me.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "it was the sweetest
'Thank you' I ever heard."</p>

<p>Again the mystified look.</p>

<p>"But where?" said she again.</p>

<p>"It was rather dark," I replied,
"and the clouds were drifting across
the sky, and you, I am afraid, did not
know who it was who received that
soft 'Thank you.'"</p>

<p>"Were you the Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>I bowed.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, and she stamped
her tiny foot, "if you were only not a
rebel!"</p>

<p>"But even rebels have their uses."</p>

<p>Thus it was we became good friends
in spite of the traitor stamped upon my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
brow. Ere I knew it, the time approached
when I had to mount and
ride. But before I left, her soft hand
rested for a moment in mine.</p>

<p>"We march in a few days," said I,
"to the North, to the Leaguer of Boston.
There will be fighting there and bloody
work. Can I not carry a single
token?"</p>

<p>Her nimble fingers flew to her hair,
and took from thence a blood-red rose,
and pinned it to my coat.</p>

<p>"There," said she, "my red cockade;"
and turning quickly, she ran into
the house.</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>SIR SQUIRE OF TORY DAMES</h3>


<p>"Well, Sir Squire of Tory Dames,
did she smile on you?" The voice
was harsh and rasping; looking across
the table, I saw the sneer upon his lips.
I had but entered a moment before the
dining-room of the inn, after my long
ride, and was about to take my seat,
when Rodolph's sneering question
made me pause.</p>

<p>"That is more than you could ever
win, my Mighty Lord from Nowhere,"
I retorted. At this there was a laugh
from those about. An angry flush
showed through even his dark and
swarthy skin; for, being a burly bully
of the border, he liked not being
bearded thus by a youth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"You damned impudent puppy!"
he cried, rising.</p>

<p>But there stood a glass at my right
hand, full to the brim, and ere he could
say another word the red wine flew
across the table straight into his face.</p>

<p>"Take that!" I cried, "with the
compliments of James Frisby of
Fairlee!"</p>

<p>A dozen men were now around us,
and Rodolph, spluttering through the
wine and swearing many oaths, demanded
to be released from the hands
upon his shoulders, shouting that he
would shoot me like a dog.</p>

<p>"It will give me pleasure to let you
have an opportunity," I replied coolly.
"It will be a rare chance for you to
become a gentleman."</p>

<p>And so, still muttering and swearing,
his friends took him from the room,
while I took my seat at the table. But
I was not allowed to eat my meal in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
peace; for many gentlemen came to
offer their services and to thank me.
Rodolph's overbearing manners had
long been unpopular among them, and
the wonder was that he had not been
forced to fight before. But I was determined
that Dick should be my second,
and so, thanking them all for their
kind offers, I placed my hand on
Dick's shoulder, and we went out together
amid a volley of advice and
friendly warning.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, as I was examining
my sword and Dick his pistols,
there came a rap on my door, and two
gentlemen entered; one was Captain
Brooke, the other Lieutenant Barry of
the Line.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Frisby," said Captain
Brooke, as he advanced and bowed, "it
is my painful duty to deliver you this
challenge."</p>

<p>"It is a pleasure to receive it from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
your hands," I replied, returning his
courtesy. "Lieutenant Ringgold and
Harry Gresham of Kent will act as my
seconds, permit me to refer you to them."</p>

<p>Dick now went out with them to
Harry Gresham's room near by, where
they would be safe from interruption,
Gresham having volunteered with Dick
to be one of my seconds, and I went
on polishing my sword, waiting for the
issue. At last Dick came back.</p>

<p>"Well," he cried, "it is all settled.
You are to fight to-morrow morning at
sunrise down in the little meadow below
the creek."</p>

<p>"Swords, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No; pistols. I insisted on swords
at first, it being our privilege; but Captain
Brooke said that Rodolph had
broken his arm the year before, and
that it was still too weak to fight with.
So I waived the swords and agreed to
the pistols."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not quite as gentlemanly a
weapon, but just as deadly. I have
put a bullet through the head of a wild
duck flying, and I think I can hit Phil
Rodolph."</p>

<p>"That you can," said Dick.</p>

<p>It was a bright, clear morning as we
slipped out of the inn on our way to
the little meadow. The eastern sky
was already tinged with crimson, and
the blood-red lances across the heavens
told of the coming dawn. The air was
fresh and cool as it blew up the river
from the bay, and our lungs drew in
great draughts of it as we felt the breeze
in our faces.</p>

<p>"A splendid morning to die on,"
said Harry Gresham.</p>

<p>"And to live on, too," I replied.</p>

<p>"Stop your croaking, Gresham," put
in Dick Ringgold. We walked on
silently to the meadow, where we found
that we were the first to arrive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Though I have stood on many a
field of honour since that day, though I
have felt the bullet tearing and burning
its way through the flesh, and the sudden,
sharp pain of the sword thrust, I
shall never forget that encounter on the
meadow beside the Elk, when I first
faced the muzzle of a hostile pistol, and
knew that the will behind it sought my
life.</p>

<p>It was not fear that I felt as I stood
there, waiting for the coming of my adversary,
for fear has always been foreign
to my family, but a sort of secret elation.
For that day, if I survived,
though the down upon my lip was as
yet imperceptible, I could take my
place as a man among men. No longer
would my boyish face keep me out of
the councils of my elders, but I would
have the right to take my stand and
ruffle it with the best of them all. I
was there to win my spurs as a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and a duellist, and to show to all the
world that I had the courage of my
race. For then, as it has ever been in
the fair province of Maryland, we love
above all else courage in a man; and so
it was I waited with impatience Rodolph's
approach, for it meant the casting
off of the boy and the making of
the man.</p>

<p>We did not have long to wait, for
Rodolph and his seconds soon followed
us down the path, and each party
saluted. Then Captain Brooke and
Dick Ringgold measured off the paces,
and threw for the choice of positions.
Dick won, and I found myself standing
near a small sapling, with my back to
the rising sun, which as yet had not
climbed over the tree tops, and so did
not interfere with Rodolph's position.
Facing me, twelve paces away, stood
Rodolph, his dark, swarthy face darker,
more Indian-like, and forbidding than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
ever; behind him stretched away the
small glade, and the smooth green
waters of the river, as they wound their
way between the tall forests on either
side. I remember watching a wild duck
as he went swiftly flying down the
Elk, when Dick Ringgold's "Are you
ready?" suddenly recalled me to my
position. "Yes," I nodded. Then came
the even counting, "One, two;" but
ere "two" had been uttered, I saw the
flash of Rodolph's pistol, and felt the
sharp pain of the bullet tearing its way
into my side. While I, taken by surprise
at such rank treachery, fired not
so accurately as usual, and my bullet
clipped his ear. Dick's sword was out
in an instant, and I verily believe he
would have run Rodolph through on
the spot, as it was his duty and right to
do, so base was the crime of firing before
the time&mdash;a thing that had never
been known among Maryland gentlemen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
before. But seeing me reel, he
came to my assistance, and threw his
arm around me.</p>

<p>"Tie me to the sapling, Dick," said
I, "and give me one more shot."</p>

<p>"But no gentleman should fight
with such a scoundrel!" cried Dick
hotly.</p>

<p>"I waive that, just one more shot."</p>

<p>So, with Harry Gresham's assistance,
they took Dick's sash and tied me to
the sapling, and in this way enabled me
to keep an upright position. Captain
Brooke had come forward to inquire as
to my injury, but Dick met him and
demanded another exchange of shots.
"My principal," he said, "waives the
treachery that places your principal beyond
the pale of men of honour. But,"
continued Dick, "if he should dare to
fire again before the time, I will shoot
him down where he stands."</p>

<p>Captain Brooke flushed, and though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
we saw that it was painful to him as a
man of honour to be the second of such a
principal, he could do nothing but accept.
"I will shoot him down myself,"
said he, "if he dares again to do it."</p>

<p>He then returned to his party, and
we saw by his angry gestures that he
was warning Rodolph of the penalty if
he should a second time transgress the
rules of honour.</p>

<p>Again we faced, and I could feel the
strength ebbing fast from me, but I
could see that Rodolph's face was pale,
even through his swarthy skin. "One,
two, three, Fire," came again the fateful
words; but I had nerved myself for
the final effort, and glancing down the
polished barrel, I fired, at the same
moment that Rodolph's pistol rang out.</p>

<p>For a moment I saw him standing
there, and then he lurched forward, with
his arms in the air, and fell face downward
as the mortally wounded do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
With that there came a mist before
my eyes, my hand fell to my side, and
I remembered nothing more. They
told me afterward that they carried me
to the inn in the village, Captain Brooke
assisting, after they had seen that Rodolph
was dead. "Leave him there for
awhile," said the Captain, as he came to
assist Dick in my removal. "The dog
had a better death than he deserved."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>A TALE IS TOLD</h3>


<p>I lay there at the inn, I do not know
how long, but they told me afterward it
was for many days, hanging on the brink
between life and death, until one day I
heard in my dreams the music of the
fife and the rattle of the drums, and
awoke to life and hope again. The sunlight
was streaming through the south
window across the counterpane of the
bed, and outside could be heard the
steady tread of marching men.</p>

<p>"What troops are those?" I asked
somewhat hazily, for I was still on the
borderland of dreams.</p>

<p>"They are the Maryland Line marching
away to the North to join General
Washington."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Marching to the North? Then I
must join them." And I tried to rise
in my bed, for it came back to me with
a rush that I was a Lieutenant in the
Line. But strong hands pushed me
gently back upon my pillow, and I recognised
now the voice of my nurse,
Mrs. McLean.</p>

<p>"No, no, Mr. Frisby; be still. You
are a regular little bantam, but your
spurs are clipped for some time yet."</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter, Mrs. McLean?
How did I come here?"</p>

<p>"Law bless the boy!" said the good
old soul. "He has clean forgot."</p>

<p>But the dull pain in my side soon
brought back to me that clear, fresh
morning on the bank of the Elk, and
for a moment I lay still.</p>

<p>"Did I kill Rodolph?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That you did, lad; and no man
deserved it more."</p>

<p>Then I heard a heavy step in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>passageway
outside, and then a lighter one.
The next moment the door opened and
I saw my mother, more pale and fairy-like
than ever, and behind her came
Captain Ramsay, bluff and hearty, but
looking very solemn at that moment.
But they saw the news on Mrs. McLean's
good-natured face, and when I
spoke to my lady, the old-time happy
look came back again, as she came to
my bedside and kissed me, while the
great voice of the Captain came hearty
and strong.</p>

<p>"Aye, lad, I told them that you would
pull through; make a gallant fight, my
boy, and you will have a shot at the
redcoats yet."</p>

<p>"But, Captain, you are marching
away without me."</p>

<p>"You will be in time for the fighting,
never worry; lie still and get well.
Half the young men in the Line are
envying you, you rogue, for becoming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
a hero before them all." And the
Captain took my hand, and bade me
good-bye, for he must hurry away to join
his regiment.</p>

<p>A few minutes later there came the
clank of a sword and a hurried step,
and then the door burst open and in
marched Master Dick in all the glory
of his full regimentals. And so brave
was the show that he made in his cocked
hat, scarlet coat, with its facings of buff,
and the long clanking sword, that I
longed to spring up and don my own
then and there. But my mother's finger
on her lip caused him to stop the cheery
greeting, and he came forward on his
tiptoes, holding his sword carefully to
keep it from clanking, for by this time
I was growing weak again. Master
Dick shook my hand gently and murmured,
"Cheer up, old fellow, you
will soon be with us again," but I could
only give him a slight smile, for I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
again on the borderland of dreams.
Dick stood for awhile looking down on
me; then he, too, had to depart. Gradually
the steady tramp of marching feet
died away, and everything became quiet
and still again.</p>

<p>The days passed by, week followed
week, and though at first I gained
strength but slowly, the process seeming
a long and dreary one, the vigour of
a youthful frame soon asserted itself,
and I could feel the returning tide of
health and strength. But as yet I lay
there upon the great four-post bed, with
my mother sitting near by, her dear face
bending over the embroidery frame, as
her deft fingers weaved beautiful designs
with the silk. As I lay there, I would
wander back again to that day before
the duel, to the swift challenging glance
of a pair of blue eyes as a blood-red
rose was pinned to my coat. But that
was so long ago, years it seemed to me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
away back in the past, a memory as it
were of a fairy tale heard from the lips
of a grandmother before the big open
fire in the great hall on a winter night;
a fairy tale, aye, and she the Princess,
with her blue eyes and hair of waving
brown, with her step as light as the dew-drop,
and her voice as low and soft as
the breath of the Southern breeze in the
spring; and then I would be her Prince
Charming, with my coal-black horse.
But, pshaw! I am becoming a child
again; whereas I am a man, who has
fought his duel as becomes a man, with
a right to the sword by his side. And
yet those blue eyes, what fate was in
store for them? And would their challenging
glance ever meet mine again?
But here my mother stopped the trend
of my thoughts for a moment.</p>

<p>"James," she said, "John Cotton
tells me that an old darky comes to
inquire for you every night. Strange,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
is it not? We know so few people
here."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied. "Does John Cotton
know who he is?"</p>

<p>"No; he refuses to tell, and all
John Cotton can find out is that he
leaves town by the river road. He
appears to be a stranger to all the
other darkies, and nobody seems to
know him."</p>

<p>By the river road! Could it possibly
be, then, that it was the Tory
maid who sent those many miles to
see if I were in the land of the living
or the dead? Ah, it was too pleasant
a thing to dream of; too pleasant to
have it shattered by the rough hand of
fact. And so I said dreamily, "It is
only one of John Cotton's stories, I
suppose."</p>

<p>Yet I would not have believed it
otherwise for all of John Cotton's
weight in gold. Thus it was I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
thinking one day of the Tory maid,
when the door opened, and a tall, dignified
gentleman came in&mdash;the man
who had stood by my side that day
when with drawn sword I held the door
against Rodolph and his followers&mdash;Mr.
Lambert Wilmer of the White
House in Kent.</p>

<p>He came forward and greeted me
with many kind phrases. While he
sat talking to me of the duel and its
cause, I thought of that great burst of
laughter when he told Rodolph to put
up his sword, as by this time he should
have had enough of Gordon of the
Braes, and I asked the reason for it
all.</p>

<p>"It is a long story, lad," said he,
"but I will tell it to you."</p>

<p>Then he told me how, many years
before, Mistress Margaret Nicholson
had been the loveliest girl in Kent, and
the belle of the whole shore, and how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
there was not a bachelor within three
counties who did not seek her as his
bride, or who would not have sold his
soul for a glance of her eyes or the soft
pressure of her hand; and how when
James Rodolph of Charlestown Hundred
came riding down from Cecil and
boasted of his wealth, his horses, and
his slaves, swearing that he would win
her or no one would, the suitors stood
aside to see how he would fare with
this the proudest of Kent beauties. To
their dismay, he seemed to prosper
well, until one day there disembarked
from a vessel that came sailing up the
broad Chester a young gentleman of
distinguished appearance, who asked
his way to Radcliffe, the home of the
Nicholsons.</p>

<p>"Now, the Nicholsons, as you
know," said Mr. Wilmer, "are Scotch,
and this young gentleman was Scotch,
for his accent betrayed him, and we,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
thinking he might be a cousin and have
brought news from over the water, welcomed
him, and showed him the way
to Radcliffe. He, though he was very
reserved, told us that he had indeed
come from over the sea, and bore a letter
to the Nicholsons, who were old
friends of his family, but of himself he
would say no more. And so, when he
strode off, we turned to Captain Hezekiah
Brown of the Maid of Perth, who
was a man who delighted to talk. From
him we learned that his name was Gordon,
and that there was a mystery about
him, as people suspected him of being
one of the young chiefs who had led
that famous clan in the recent rebellion
against the King. But this we held
not to his injury, for there were still
many lovers of the White Rose in the
fair province of Maryland, and we
afterward welcomed him the more
heartily for it. From the advent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the stranger the good fortune of James
Rodolph began to wane; for the rich
planter of the border, with his wild and
boisterous manners, was no match for
the Scottish cavalier. It is true that
he was penniless, but he was very handsome,
of distinguished manners and address,
and when it became known that
he was out in 'forty-five' the mantle
of romance that fell around Prince
Charles was shared as well by him, and
he became the hero of many a pair of
fair eyes.</p>

<p>"James Rodolph soon saw this, and
his hatred grew from day to day, as his
rival became more successful. One day
there was a quarrel, and next morning,
upon the smooth, sandy shore of the
river, they met and fought it out.
Rodolph was fiery, quick, and fierce;
Gordon cool and steady; until Rodolph,
growing weary and desperate, tried a foul
and dangerous stroke, to find his rapier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
flying through the air, to fall with a
splash into the river.</p>

<p>"'I would not stain my blade by
killing you,' said Gordon; and turning
with the other gentlemen who had seen
the foul stroke, he walked away, leaving
him there.</p>

<p>"And so it was that Rodolph came
back to Cecil with a blot upon his name,
and Gordon married the maid, and became
in time the owner of the Braes,
for she was an heiress as well as a great
beauty. From that time has grown the
feud which we may some day see the
end of. And that is why the people
laughed and Rodolph slunk away. For
the old story is known throughout the
shore, and Rodolph proved, in his
fight with you, the bad blood in his
veins. It never does to cross the white
blood with the red, for the treachery
of the Indian will taint the race for
generations."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it was, by the light of this old
tale of thirty years before, I saw and
read the cause and reason of it all&mdash;of
his fatal course, of our quarrel, and of
the meeting by the banks of the river
Elk.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE DEFIANCE OF THE TORY</h3>


<p>A few weeks later I was up and out,
fast gaining strength and courage for
the long ride to the northward to join
the gallant fellows of the Maryland
Line, who had taken up their line of
march soon after the accident befell me.
And though I was eager to be off, the
surgeon would not let me go, and so,
until I could gather strength for the
long journey, I served as best I could
my country and the commands of the
Committee of Public Safety sitting at
the Head of Elk. Thus it was I rode
one day by the side of Edward Veasey,
High Sheriff of the county of Cecil,
carrying the writ and command of the
Committee of Public Safety to Charles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Gordon of the Braes, now a suspected
Tory and a malcontent. And as I rode
by the side of the High Sheriff on this
most unpleasant task, I longed to turn
back and let the Sheriff ride on alone;
but duty held me as a point of honour.
For as it was, I was carrying I knew
not what ruin and destruction to the
roof of the very house that once had
received me as a guest and that sheltered
the fairest eyes that had ever gazed in
mine. And now I was to appear before
that house as the bearer of ill-tidings.
Ah, duty often wears a gruesome countenance;
yet it is a sign of courage to
face this duty down, and I sat more
firmly in my saddle and rode nearer to
the High Sheriff. He was a stern and
determined man; he was short of stature,
stout of frame, and sat his powerful
horse like the fox-hunter that he was.
But, though it was the height of summer,
and the hills and the forests were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
green, the air laden with the odour of
flowers, and the streams full and rushing,
there was anything but a smile on
the High Sheriff's face. For though
he was no friend to Gordon of the
Braes, he liked not the errand on which
he rode, and would gladly have turned
his horse's head with me.</p>

<p>"If they want to fight," said he to
me, "why don't they join the Maryland
Line and leave men alone who are disposed
to be quiet? They will have
enough to do in repulsing the redcoats,
and should not stir up opposition in the
rear of our armies, which this persecution
of private individuals will certainly
do. I wish some other carried this
writ, and I was with the lads fighting
in the North."</p>

<p>"Aye, so do I, but it is the order of
the committee," said I grimly.</p>

<p>"True, and as such must be obeyed."</p>

<p>We had come to where the ferry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
crosses the Elk, and hailing it we were
soon on the south bank and taking up
again the road that leads to the Braes.
Over the hills and dales of Cecil, the
forest, streams, and rivers, the soft warm
sunlight played, and nature blessed
with lavish hand the harvest of the
year. Seldom had she been more
pleasing, the earth bursting with flowers
and the very trees welcoming with
outstretched arms the soft breezes wafted
from the bay. And then, after some
hours' travelling, we came to the Braes
and I saw again the long rambling
house amid the trees. I took a firmer
grip upon my sense of duty and rode
on. The clatter of our horses' hoofs as
we rode up to the door announced us.
A moment later Charles Gordon came
through the open doorway on to the
porch. Though I had seen him before,
it seemed to me, as I saw him standing
there, with the memory of the old tale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in my mind, that I saw not the Tory,
but one of those figures of romance that
stepped out from the mystery and the
haze of the North, when Prince Charles
raised his standard in the Highlands,
one of those heroic men who drew
swords with Wallace and with Bruce,
rallied with Montrose, and went to
death with a cheer behind Bonnie
Dundee at Killiecrankie, of such gallant
bearing and bold and open countenance
was he.</p>

<p>"What brings you here, Mr. Sheriff,
riding so fast?"</p>

<p>"I come, Charles Gordon of the
Braes," replied the Sheriff, "to serve
on you the writ and summons of the
Committee of Public Safety." And
here he unfolded the summons and read
aloud, sitting on his horse as he was:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Whereas</i>, Great complaints have this day
been made against Charles Gordon of the
Braes, for that he has infamously reflected on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the membership of this Committee and the
deputies of this county who lately attended
the Provincial Convention,</p>

<p>"These are therefore requiring the said
Charles Gordon of the Braes that he appear
before this Committee, at the house of Thomas
Savin at the Head of Elk, to-morrow at two
o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, to answer unto said complaints.</p>

<p>"Hereto fail not on your peril.</p></div>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">"James Rodolph</span>, Chairman.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">"To Charles Gordon</span> of the Braes."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Then spoke Charles Gordon:</p>

<p>"Go tell those who sent you, Mr.
Sheriff, that if they wish to see Charles
Gordon they will have to come to the
Braes to do so; that I will give them a
right warm welcome, as my plantation
is large enough to hold them all; but
that if any of their rascally crew dare to
approach the house, there will be lives
lost; for I say to you, Mr. Sheriff, as I
have said before and will say again, that
James Rodolph and his committee are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
a set of infamous scoundrels, who have
usurped such power and authority in
troublous times as the King himself
would not dare to claim. Tell them
that I am at their defiance, that I do
not recognise their authority, and that
I have as much contempt for them as I
have for their dogs."</p>

<p>The old gentleman, for he must have
been nearly sixty, looked splendid in
his wrath, as he denounced the Committee
of Public Safety. The ring in
his voice told that the ire of the Scot
was rising.</p>

<p>For an instant the High Sheriff hesitated,
as if he would turn and go, but
then he said:</p>

<p>"Charles Gordon, I spoke to you a
moment ago as an officer of the law. I
speak to you now as one who does not
wish you an injury. Obey the order
of the committee, and I will see that
you have fair speech before it. Refuse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and you will be declared a traitor and
an outlaw, and the edict will go forth
through all the province that no man
shall buy of you, that no man shall sell
to you, and he that shows you kindness
will become an outlaw like yourself."</p>

<p>Charles Gordon laughed.</p>

<p>"Do you think I care a snap of a
finger for their edict? There has not
been a generation of my family that
has not been at the Horn at Edinburgh
for high treason. Do you think that I
care when my neck has been on the
block for the part I took at Preston
Pans and Culloden? Go frighten the
children with their edicts, but not an
old Scot who has seen the claymores
flash and led the charge for the King
who is over the sea."</p>

<p>"If you fought against the father,
why not against the son?"</p>

<p>"A fair question deserves a fair answer.
When my head was on the block<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
my life was saved by the intercession of
the Duchess of Gordon, but upon conditions,
and those conditions are these:
That I should nevermore bear arms
against the King, that I should leave
the realm of Scotland, sail across the
sea to the province of Maryland, there
remain and never return. So, though
I love not the King nor his race, I will
not draw sword against him, for never
yet has a Gordon broken faith with
friend or foe. Yet for all that I will
not take up arms for the King's cause
unless I am forced to do so by such
rascals as compose your Committee of
Public Safety."</p>

<p>"So be it, then, but I wish it were
otherwise," said the Sheriff; and, turning,
we rode away, leaving him standing
there. As I entered the woods I
looked back again, my eyes searching
every window in the old house, but
never a sign of the Tory maid did I see.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE BLACK COCKADE</h3>


<p>It was two o'clock next day when we
rode up to the house where the Committee
of Public Safety held its meetings,
dismounted, and entered the room.
Six gentlemen sat at the long table, and
the room was crowded with hangers-on.
They were men who stayed behind
while the others went to the war; they
fought the fight with their tongues,
with writs of forfeiture for high treason,
became great statesmen, and in time
aspired to become members of the committee.
How the worthy High Sheriff
regarded them could be seen by the
manner in which he brushed past them
to stand before the committee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"What right have you to talk of
liberty and of freedom, if you will not
fight for it? Why are you not with
Howard, Gist, Smallwood, and the
other heroes who are making the name
of the Maryland Line ring through the
army?" he would ask, and they would
turn away.</p>

<p>The burly form and dark, swarthy
face of the Chairman dominated the
committee. As we entered and stood
before him his dark eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"Do you bring the body of Charles
Gordon with you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"No; I do not. I bring his defiance,
instead;" and the High Sheriff
delivered the message of Charles Gordon
to the committee.</p>

<p>The committee glanced from one to
another, and there was a big stir in the
room. Then the Chairman was on his
feet.</p>

<p>"By a thousand devils," he swore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
"Charles Gordon shall suffer for this.
I will not stop until the Braes is razed
to the ground, and I have driven him
from the province. He is a Tory and
a traitor, and a danger to the peace of
the county. He will be up in arms
next. Mr. Sheriff, summon a posse
and ride to the Braes and bring us the
body of Charles Gordon, dead or
alive."</p>

<p>"You will not accept the invitation
to go to the Braes yourself, then?"
asked the High Sheriff gravely, though
there was the suggestion of a smile
around the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>The Chairman hesitated. "No,"
he said; "it is absolutely necessary for
the welfare of the county of Cecil that
we should remain where we are and not
engage in any brawls or tumults, for if
we are killed who will take our places?"</p>

<p>"That is true," said the High
Sheriff ironically, "but have you <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>considered,
gentlemen, that Charles Gordon's
wife was of the Nicholsons of
Kent, who, as you know, are the leaders
of the patriots in that county? How
will they like it when they hear of your
burnings and your razings?"</p>

<p>The Chairman frowned. "You are
right," he said; "we must proceed
about it in a legal way, which is slow
but sure. Mr. Clerk, institute proceedings
against Charles Gordon for
the forfeiture of his lands for high treason,
and meanwhile we will publish
him throughout the province as a Tory
and a traitor. We will teach this
Charles Gordon and all Tories what
it means to contemn the authority
and dignity of this province and its
committee."</p>

<p>And then applause broke out from
the crowd; but the High Sheriff, who
left the room with me, shrugged his
shoulders and said: "If they had half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of the courage of that Scot they would
not be loafing around here, applauding
James Rodolph. I am tired of it; I
am going to resign and go to the front."
He was as good as his word, for that
very day he resigned the office of High
Sheriff of the county of Cecil, packed
his saddle-bags, gathered some volunteers
about him, and rode away to the
North, becoming in time a noted officer.
But it was not until the month of
August of that year that I was ready to
follow him and felt equal to the length
of the journey. On the night of the
day before I took my departure I called
John Cotton and ordered him to saddle
Toby.</p>

<p>John Cotton received the order with
wide-open eyes, as it was growing somewhat
late.</p>

<p>"Fo' de Lord's sake, Mars Jim, what
do you want Toby fo'? It's after ten
o'clock."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ask no questions, you black rascal,
and bring Toby around in a hurry."</p>

<p>Then his eyes fell on a cluster of red
roses on my table, and a broad grin
crept from ear to ear.</p>

<p>"Sartin, Mars Jim, sartin;" and he
was out of the door before my flying
boot could repay the impertinence of
that grin. A few minutes later I
slipped out of the house to the stables,
and, mounting Toby, was soon riding
out of the silent town, having hit that
rascal John Cotton across the shoulders
with my whip for the snickering laugh
he could not restrain as I was riding off.</p>

<p>Have you ever ridden by the silent
river after the night has fallen, and
when it is far advanced? The great
trees, rising far above you like the
vaulted arch of a cathedral, overhanging
the path down which you ride; the
smooth flowing waters of the river, the
towering dark mass on the farther shore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and over all the glorious moon shining
down flooding everything with its silvery
light, weird and fantastic, glinting
now like polished steel upon the waters,
now deepening the shadows of the
forest, or flooding again with its glorious
radiance some wide and sweeping
stretch of water. And then, the unearthly
silence of it all, the mournful
howl of the wolf in the hills, and the
piercing shrill cry of the wildcat, like
that of a child tortured by the demons
of hell; then the horror of its beauty,
its stillness and its loneliness, comes
over you; nervous chills become distinctly
apparent, and you put spurs to
your horse and ride on more rapidly,
and the night is broken first by your
whistle and then by your song. So it
was, as I rode by the banks of the Elk,
that night in early August, and my
voice rang across the waters, as I sang
the old Highland ballad:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Gordons cam', and the Gordons ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they were stark and steady,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And aye the word among them a'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was, Gordons, keep you ready.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A ballad that I heard a young girl
sing one day not long before. Thus
the length of my ride passed quickly
away until Toby felt the soft grass
under his feet as I rode silently across
the lawn. Her window was high, it is
true, but it was open to admit the
fresh, cool breeze from the bay, and
then I had not thrown quoits in my
youth not to be able to surmount so
small a difficulty. So I fastened a
black cockade amid the blood-red of
the roses, and, rising in my stirrups,
threw them firmly and gently, and saw
them rise in the air, top the window-sill,
and fall with a slight thud upon
the floor. I did not wait for more,
but turned and rode away; but it
seemed to me that as I gained the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
shadow of the forest and looked back I
saw the faint suggestion of a girlish
form standing at the open window. I
looked once again and rode on.</p>

<p>When morning came, I bade good-bye
to my mother, mounted my black colt
Toby, and rode away to join the Maryland
Line, which was marching now
from Boston, to meet the British before
New York. As that day I crossed the
line into the province of Delaware, I
saw nailed to a great oak the proclamation
of the Committee of Public Safety,
denouncing Charles Gordon as a Tory
and a traitor, and calling upon all persons
to have no dealings with him,
either in public or private, at their peril.
And thus it was at every cross-roads
in the county of Cecil, and in all the
counties to the south and west, the
edict had gone forth.</p>

<p>Now in Maryland, as I have said
before, we love, above all else, courage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in a man, and so I rode under the oak,
and tore down the proclamation, for I
knew the courage of Charles Gordon,
Tory though he was. I knew also that
the proceedings of forfeiture had been
instituted against him in the High
Court of the Province, and that ere I
set foot on the soil of Maryland again,
he would be driven from the province,
and it was for this that I paid this
courtesy to the courage of an enemy,
as I left my native plains behind me.</p>

<p>It was a long road for a lad, but the
people received me with open arms and
urged me on when I told them whither
I was riding. After several days of
travelling along the shore of the Delaware
and across the low-lying plains of
New Jersey, I came to the banks of
the Hudson, and saw across the water
the great city of New York, its clustering
houses and steeples. And then it
was not long before I was on the ferry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
that conveyed me across the river, and
heard the sharp ring of the pavement
under my horse's feet as I rode toward
the great common where lay the encampment
of the troops. It was near
twelve o'clock when I came to the camp
of the patriots and asked my way of
an officer to the quarters of the Maryland
Line.</p>

<p>"You must be a stranger," he said,
"or you would know that the Maryland
Line always has the place of honour in
the camp;" and he showed me where
their quarters lay.</p>

<p>I felt aglow with pride when I heard
this tribute to my countrymen. I
thanked him and rode on. A few
minutes later I was among them. The
great voice of the Captain was giving
me greeting; Dick Ringgold's hand
was on my shoulder, as he took charge
of me; and many of my kith and kin,
old friends and neighbours who belonged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to that famous corps, came forward to
greet and welcome me to the camp.
Thus, after many days of sickness and
of travel, I took my place among the
men who were about to face the great
storm. True, at the time quiet reigned
all along our front, which lay over beyond
the heights of Brooklyn; but hot
work was soon expected, as the British
fleet had been seen in the offing, and it
was only a question of time when the
army would be landed and the attack
begun.</p>

<p>It was on the 22d day of August
that the rumour flew through the camp
that the enemy had landed and was
preparing to attack. But the hours
flew by, and still no orders came, until
the Line became restless, and the fear
grew that the fight would begin before
we could reach the field of battle. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
sun began to sink over the Heights of
Harlem when an aide rode into our
lines. It was Tench Tilghman, who
swung his hat and shouted as he went
by: "You will have warm work in a
day or two, boys!"</p>

<p>We gave him a yell in reply, and
started with renewed interest the preparations
for the coming fight. A few
minutes later came the orders that we
were to march at dawn. The men
received the news joyfully, and it was
wonderful to see the change in their
bearing; for while the doubt hung
over them, they were restless and
murmuring was heard all through the
camp; but now all was laughter and
gaiety. They prepared for the fight as
one would prepare for the next county
ball or a fox-hunt on the morrow.</p>

<p>The stirring notes of the bugle ringing
over the camp brought me to my
feet with a bound, and I looked out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the tent to see a heavy mist over everything,
and hear the sound of men's
voices coming through it all around
me. It does not take a soldier long
to don his uniform, and I was soon out
attending to my duties. At seven
o'clock we were on our march to the
ferry, crossing the East River at the
foot of the main street of the small
town of Brooklyn; then we took a
road leading over a creek called Gowanus,
and knew that we were marching
to guard the right of the American
line. Low-lying hills, heavily wooded,
lay before us; it was in these woods
that our line was called to a halt, and
we took up our position for the battle.
We lay there several days, with
constant rumours flying through the
camp of the enemy's advance, but yet
they would not come.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the 27th
of August that the great battle of Long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Island, so disastrous for the patriot
forces, broke upon us. The scattering
shots of the skirmishers first made us
spring to arms; then the sharp rattle
of the musketry of Atlee's men and
the boom of Carpenter's cannon on our
immediate right told that the enemy
was pushing them hard. Then through
the forest trees came the line of the
British advance. The fire extended
along our whole front, while far over,
to our left came the distant roar of
cannon and musketry.</p>

<p>"They are having a hot time over
there," said Dick, "but why don't
these fellows charge us?"</p>

<p>"They will charge us soon enough,"
I replied. But it seemed as if they
never would, for what promised to be
an attack along our whole line dwindled
down to a mere exchange of shots.
Hour after hour went by, and yet they
never advanced beyond a certain point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
except when a company or so would
dash forward and a sharp skirmish would
break forth for a moment or two, and
then die away again. But far over to
our left the sound of the battle came
rolling nearer and nearer, telling the
tale of Sullivan's men being driven in.</p>

<p>"I do not like that," said Dick.
"They are doing all the fighting, while
we are merely exchanging courtesies
with our friends six hundred yards
away. Hello! There comes news."</p>

<p>I looked behind us to a small hill,
where Lord Stirling stood with his staff,
and saw Tench Tilghman riding up at
full speed. There was a hurried movement
among the staff, and Stirling's
glasses swept the country to our left
and rear. A moment later an order
was given and the aides came dashing
down our lines, and then, to our disgust,
came the order to retire.</p>

<p>"Retreat!" cried one of the men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
"Why, we haven't begun to fight
yet!"</p>

<p>"Steady, men," cried Captain Ramsay;
"you form the rear guard and
must hold the enemy in check," for
they were beginning to advance as the
regiments on each side of us withdrew.
Then we began slowly to withdraw, but
there came an aide riding swiftly to
Major Gist. Pennsylvania and Delaware
regiments took our place in the
rear, and we were marched rapidly to
the front. The heavy woods had heretofore
prevented our seeing what was
taking place, but now that we had
come out to the opening a wild scene
of terror and dismay lay before us.
Gowanus Creek, deep and unfordable,
with its sullen tide rising fast, lay
like a great ugly serpent across our
path, while over the meadow and far in
our front the broken streams of fugitives
were swarming, flying toward the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
bridge at the mill, the only hope of crossing
Gowanus Creek. And as I looked,
to my horror, the mill and the bridge
burst into flames, catching the routed
army as it were between the rising tide
and the advancing legions of the victorious
English. Then, as we watched
it, a rumour grew and spread through
the ranks, as such things will in battle,
that a New England Colonel had fired
the bridge to save himself and his regiment.
How we cursed New England
then, and swore that if we ever escaped
we would have our reckoning with her
and her people.</p>

<p>"There they come!" cried Dick at
my side, pointing to where a large
stone house crowned a hill immediately
in the rear and commanded the whole
field of the terror-stricken fugitives.</p>

<p>I saw the brilliant scarlet of their
coats as they took possession of the
hill and prepared to open fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"They will have to be driven from
there or we are lost," I answered.</p>

<p>Then, as the prospect looked the
darkest and the long line of the British
formed to make their last advance,
Lord Stirling rode up to our line.</p>

<p>"Men of Maryland!" he shouted,
"charge that hill, hold Cornwallis in
check and save the army!"</p>

<p>We answered with a yell, as he
sprang from his horse to lead us.</p>

<p>Ah, I shall never forget the pride
with which we stepped out of the mass
of flying fugitives, four hundred Marylanders,
the greatest dandies and bluest
blood in all the army, for this, the
proudest service of the day. We
formed for the charge as if on the drill
ground; our evolutions and lines were
perfect, and would have done credit
to the grenadiers of the later empire.
Stirling's sword was in the air, the
drums were beating the charge, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
there broke from the throats of our
Marylanders the wild, thrilling yell of
the southern provinces, and we leaped
to the charge up the long hill, straight
into the face of Cornwallis's army, a
handful against thousands. Up, up the
hill we dashed. A fire as of hell broke
upon us and rattled and roared about
our ears, thinning our ranks and strewing
our pathway with the dead. Men
fell to the right and to the left of me,
and I strode across the bodies of the
slain in my path; but still, over the
roar of the cannon and the rattle of
musketry, high and shrill rose the yell
of the charging line. We swept up
the hill, the crest was gained, and the
British fell back before us, when we
were met by a sheet of flame, a storm
of lead and smoke and fire. We were
raised as it were in the air and held
there gasping for breath, and then we
were swept back down the hill, struggling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
desperately to gain a foothold to
make a stand.</p>

<p>Again we saw Stirling glance over
the meadow and the marsh behind us
as we re-formed our line. His voice
came ringing down our ranks.</p>

<p>"Once again, men of Maryland."</p>

<p>Once again! Aye, we knew how to
answer that call, for the bodies of our
comrades lay dotting the long hillside.</p>

<p>"Once again, and charge home!"
cried Ramsay.</p>

<p>We sprang to the charge, and wilder,
shriller, fiercer, more terrible, rose the
yell&mdash;the yell of vengeance that seemed
to pick the line up bodily and hurl it
up the hill through the scorching, blistering
storm and hail of lead, fire, and
smoke. I remembered naught till the
crest was gained, and Edward Veasey crying,
"Charge home! Charge home!"
and we dashed in upon the scarlet line.
Ah me, for a moment, then it was glorious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
as steel met steel, and we drove
them, ten times our number, back, and
rolled them up against the house and
forced them off the plain. And then
our hands were on the ugly muzzles of
the guns, and Edward Veasey, springing
on the carriage, cheered on his men.
But ere it had died on his lips, so desperate
was the struggle, the English Captain
of the guns fired, and Veasey fell. I was
but a dozen steps away, and, seeing
Veasey fall, I dashed through the press
of bayonets to where the English Captain
fought.</p>

<p>"Another one!" he cried, as we met
face to face.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the last;" and our swords
met.</p>

<p>"No time for that!" cried a voice
at my side; then there was a flash, and
the Englishman fell back into the arms
of his men, and the guns were won for
an instant. But only for an instant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Our men melted away under the storm
of lead from the Cortelyou house, and
the weight of the advancing regiments
forced us back to the crest of the hill.
Then slowly, step by step, down the
hill they forced us, until we rested once
more at its foot.</p>

<p>But still the meadow, the marsh, and
the creek were black with the mass of
flying men seeking eagerly, desperately
to escape, while between them and the
victorious British stretched the ranks
of the Maryland Line, now sadly
thinned, for one-third of our men were
dyeing the long dank grass with their
blood. But that line, thin as it was,
closed up the wide gaps in the ranks
with as jaunty a step and as gallant a
carriage as when they first stepped out
for the charge. Their faces looked
grim, it is true, for with the smoke and
the fire, and the blood and the dust, the
genius of battle had sketched thereon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>For a few minutes we rested at the
foot of the hill, for we knew that our
work was not half done, and until the
last fugitive was over Gowanus Creek
we must check the British advance. A
glance from Lord Stirling told us to
charge, as he pointed up the long hill
with his sword.</p>

<p>Again there came the answering yell,
the requiem for many a gallant soul,
and the line once more swung forward
to breast the hill. Up the long hill
we toiled again, straight into the teeth
of the fire.</p>

<p>Again we gained the crest and fought
them, man to man; again by weight of
numbers they forced us off the crest,
and sent us staggering, reeling down
the hill, desperate now.</p>

<p>Yet again Lord Stirling called on us
to follow, and yet again we charged
them home.</p>

<p>Men lay wounded, men lay dying,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
all across the long hillside, and more
than half our number were dead or
sorely stricken.</p>

<p>Yet it was for a fifth time that Stirling's
voice rang clear, over the roar of
the battle, and for the fifth time we
picked up the gauge of their challenge,
and swept forward in the charge.</p>

<p>Thus for the last time we reached the
crest, and for one heroic moment held
our own, and then came reeling back
from the shock. And, as I was carried
down the hill with the retreating line, I
saw the tall figure of Lord Stirling
standing upright and alone amid the
storm of bullets, courting death and
disdaining to retreat.</p>

<p>"To the rescue of Lord Stirling," I
cried to the few soldiers who were
around me. Dick, who was near,
echoed my shout, and we dashed forward,
determined to bring him off by
force if no other way could be found.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>But we had not advanced a dozen
yards before every man that was with us
had fallen and only Dick and I reached
Lord Stirling, who was calmly awaiting
the end.</p>

<p>"The day is lost, my lord," I cried,
"but we have yet time to save you."</p>

<p>"Save yourselves, lads," he replied;
"you have done everything that men
can do, but it remains for me either to
die or surrender."</p>

<p>"My lord," I cried; but at this
moment Dick reeled. "Struck, by
George!" he exclaimed, and I caught
him as he fell.</p>

<p>"See to your comrade," said Lord
Stirling; "you have yet time to escape."</p>

<p>So, throwing Dick's arms around my
neck, for there was no time to parley
under that rain of lead, I bore him
quickly down the hill.</p>

<p>But our work had not been in vain,
for as a soldier came to my assistance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
I saw that the last of the
fugitives had reached the other side,
and the army for the moment was
saved.</p>

<p>And so, when we reached the banks
of Gowanus Creek, we formed in line
once more and gave a parting yell of
defiance; then, turning, we plunged into
the creek and swam to the other side,
while the shot and grape from the English
on the hill tore across the whole
surface of the water.</p>

<p>Dick was badly wounded, but, with
the soldier's assistance, I swam with him
across the creek and bore him safely
out of the range of the fire.</p>

<p>Ah, it was but a shadow of our former
line when we formed once more, but the
great General himself came to thank us,
and that shadow of a line was worth
a thousand men.</p>

<p>Thereafter we claimed as our own the
post of honour in advance or in retreat;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
during the famous march on the night
after the battle, and in the retreat to
White Plains, we formed the rear guard,
and the army felt secure.</p>

<p>There came a breathing time one day
during the retreat, and the General rode
up to our lines. We greeted him with
the yell he loved to hear, for it brought
back to him the Southland and the
hunting fields of Old Virginia.</p>

<p>Then he told our officers that he
wanted us to pick out the youngest of
our line to carry a special despatch to
the Committee of Public Safety, sitting
at Annapolis, announcing the battle and
the famous part we had taken therein.
The choice fell on me, as poor Dick
was groaning in the hospital, but luckily
out of danger from his wound.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, how old are you?"
said the General, smiling down upon
me, as I saluted.</p>

<p>"Eighteen, General."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think you can carry this
safely?"</p>

<p>"I was in the charge at Gowanus
Ford, General," said I modestly.</p>

<p>"I see," laughed the General, "you
are a true Marylander. I wish I had
more of you in the army."</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE HARRYING OF THE TORY</h3>


<p>I was soon riding southward, the
bearer of the message from General
Washington to the Council of Safety, sitting
at Annapolis; and as I rode, the
people hailed me for my news, and gave
me food and drink, so I could hurry on.</p>

<p>At last I reached the borders of
Maryland, and again rode under the
old oak from which I had torn the
proclamation. It was only a few weeks
before, and I wondered what had been
the fate of Charles Gordon.</p>

<p>So, as I rode through the Head of
Elk late that afternoon and came to
the ferry there, I asked the boatman
what they had done with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forfeiture has been decreed," he
answered, "and the new High Sheriff
and James Rodolph have gone to-day
with a posse and many men to root the
traitor out."</p>

<p>"How long ago did they start?"</p>

<p>"About an hour."</p>

<p>"What road did they take?"</p>

<p>"The river road. They expect to
reach there about nine o'clock. Jupiter!
I'd like to be there and see the flames
reddening the sky. It will be a grand
sight." He looked longingly through
the forest toward the Braes.</p>

<p>"Something else will be dyed crimson,
if I know that Tory right."</p>

<p>"That there will be, sir; it will be
a lovely scrimmage;" and he sighed at
the lost opportunity.</p>

<p>The boat grounded on the south
bank, and I mounted Toby.</p>

<p>"A pleasant ride, sir."</p>

<p>"Thanks; good-night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Toby," said I, as I patted his neck,
"you have travelled many a mile to-day,
old fellow; but you will have to
cover the ground to-night as you never
covered it before. They have an hour's
start, and we have a longer distance to
go; so double your legs under you, my
boy, and go."</p>

<p>Toby rising to the occasion, and the
spirit of old Ranter proving true, he
broke into the long even gallop that
makes the miles pass swiftly. It was
a race against time, against James Rodolph
and his crew. I knew if once
they gained the Braes, black death would
stalk among the ruins, for Charles Gordon
would never surrender.</p>

<p>The night fell rapidly as we raced
along and the miles flew by.</p>

<p>As Toby and I drew near Bohemia
Manor, where the road joined the one
on which the posse was marching, I
reined him in and rode more cautiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
It was well that I did so, for as I
approached I heard the low murmur
of men's voices and saw their figures in
the dim light as they were marching
by.</p>

<p>I brought Toby to a halt. The
road was cut off that way, so I wheeled
him around to ride back a short distance
to where the road skirted the
open fields of Bohemia Manor. As
Toby plunged forward in answer to my
spur, I heard a cry and then a shot
came whistling by. But I left them
behind, and coming to the open fields,
I put Toby at the fence and raced
across the open country, through the
lower fields to the Braes, Toby taking
the fences in his stride.</p>

<p>Then I dashed once more across the
green lawn of the Braes and drew my
sword hilt across the shutter.</p>

<p>There was a stir in the room above
me; the shutter was cautiously opened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and I was covered by the muzzle
of a pistol.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded a voice
which I knew to be Charles Gordon's.</p>

<p>"James Frisby of Fairlee," I replied.
"I have ridden to warn you,
Mr. Gordon. You have only a few
minutes to escape in; James Rodolph,
with a hundred men behind him, will
be here in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Thank you, lad, for the information.
I will give them a warm
reception."</p>

<p>"But you cannot hold the Braes
against a hundred men; they will burn
you out, and then Mistress Jean."</p>

<p>"Hum; that is so, lad. Ride round
to the rear of the house."</p>

<p>I did so, and a moment later, they
came out on the little porch. The old
gentleman had buckled on his sword,
and there were pistols in his belt. And
she, ah! she never looked more <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>bewitching.
Her beautiful hair flowed
wild about her shoulders, over the light
dark mantle in which she was wrapped.
By the flicker of the candle, I saw that
a bright flush mantled her cheek, as
she spoke rapidly.</p>

<p>"Father, there is an English vessel
a few miles down the bay. Call the
slaves and escape to it."</p>

<p>"But I cannot take you there."</p>

<p>"I will carry her through the lines,"
I cried, "and see her safe in the hands
of her aunt in Kent."</p>

<p>They hesitated, but the noise in
front of the house told of the approaching
mob, and there was no time for
parley. So, true to my race, I acted
quickly, and stooping from my saddle I
caught her up gently and placed her
on Toby before me.</p>

<p>"It is the only chance, lad. See
that you carry her safely."</p>

<p>"I will carry her through or die," I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
replied with deep conviction. At the
touch of the spur Toby sprang forward
under his double burden.</p>

<p>"The creek," she cried.</p>

<p>"Yes; but we can swim it."</p>

<p>Indeed it was our only way, as the
mob blocked the other roads of escape,
so we rode boldly in and swam for the
other side. The creek was several
hundred yards wide, but Toby bore
us bravely until we reached the southern
shore, then he plunged forward,
threw himself up the bank, and we
were out of immediate danger.</p>

<p>There we halted for a moment under
the shadow of a great tree and looked
back across the water.</p>

<p>We heard the sound of many voices,
the howling of the mob, and through
the trunks of the trees flickered the
glare of the torches. Suddenly shots
rang out, a cry of dismay and rage
followed, and then the flash of guns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and a rattling volley crashed around
the house.</p>

<p>"By Jove, he is fighting it out!"
But the slender figure on my arm
trembled, and I saw that her face was
white through the darkness.</p>

<p>"He will escape, Mistress Jean," I
said reassuringly; "trust an old Highlander
for that." And I saw that her
eyes were bright and tense, watching
the scene across the water.</p>

<p>"There he goes," she exclaimed joyfully;
and there, gliding swiftly through
the waters, where the shadow of the
trees made the darkness more intense,
was a long low boat rowed by stalwart
slaves. The sound of the oars was
drowned by the clamour of the mob.</p>

<p>"If he passes the neck," I exclaimed,
"he will be safe;" for the creek narrowed
at its mouth until it was but a
hundred yards wide.</p>

<p>"Ride quick to the point," she said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>So Toby plunged forward again at
the pressure of my knees, and though
he still went gallantly on, I could tell
that the strain and the toil of the long
march from the north, and his dash
from the Head of Elk, were beginning
to tell on him.</p>

<p>At last we reached the mouth of the
creek, and I brought Toby to a halt
under the shadow of a clump of trees,
where we could see and yet not be
seen. I glanced for a moment out
over the waters of the bay, and I
saw, several miles to the southward,
the gleam of a light as it fell on the
waves; I knew it was the English
man-of-war.</p>

<p>But Mistress Jean's eyes were eagerly
searching the waters of the creek, and
she was straining her ears to catch the
sound of the oars. Then we were rewarded.
For at that moment we heard
the long sweep of the oars in the water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and out from the mouth of the creek
came the boat, the brawny negroes
bending to their task.</p>

<p>The commanding figure of the old
Tory stood in the stern, looking back
up the creek whence they came. Unconsciously
my glance followed his, and
I saw that the sky was crimson, and
high above the tree-tops the flames
licked the skies.</p>

<p>"The Braes!" I exclaimed, and
Mistress Jean was about to call out,
when there came the sound of galloping
hoofs on the other side. A horseman
dashed into view, and rode into
the water up to the saddle-girths.
There was a flash, and the crack of a
pistol broke the stillness of the night;
then with a gesture of rage, the horseman
rose in his stirrups and hurled the
pistol far over the water; we heard the
splash as it fell.</p>

<p>Then the figure in the boat raised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
his clenched hand and shook it at the
horseman and the flames.</p>

<p>"You fired too quick, Mr. Rodolph,"
said the ferryman.</p>

<p>"Yes, damn him, he has escaped."
He turned his horse and rode into the
darkness, while a soft voice whispered
in my ear,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank God."</p>

<h3>THE COUNCIL OF SAFETY</h3>


<p>The sun had risen when we came
once more in view of the groves of
Fairlee. Toby's pace had degenerated
into a walk, as if not to disturb the fair
burden he bore, for she, overcome with
fatigue and excitement, was quietly
sleeping with her head on my shoulder.
Toby picked his way like a dancing-master,
and though the road was
rough, never once did he stumble; he
still bore himself gallantly for the old
House of Fairlee. Ah! Toby, that
road was miles too short for your master.
Willingly would he have ridden
thus, aye, until his hair had turned as
white as snow on his brows, until the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
hand that guided the reins became too
feeble to grasp them; aye, even unto
the end of time.</p>

<p>But before us lay Fairlee, and beyond
that lay duty and the army.
"Look once more, my cavalier," said
I to myself; "look once more, for the
moments are short, and in the days to
come, in the dreary bivouacs and on
the long marches, when the world
seems bare and cold, the memory of
that sweet face will brighten up with
sunshine your existence and make it all
glorious again. Oh, hang it, here is
Fairlee!"</p>

<p>"Mistress Jean," I whispered. I
was loath to wake her, but it had to be
done. "Mistress Jean!" I said, this
time louder, and she awoke with a
start. "This is Fairlee, and you can
rest here with my mother, while I push
on."</p>

<p>"Fairlee? Why, where am I? Oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
I remember now. Did I go to sleep,
Mr. Frisby?"</p>

<p>"You did, Mistress Jean."</p>

<p>A quick, blush came.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "how can I thank
you? I don't deserve&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Mistress Jean, it is I who do
not deserve that pleasure. I would go
through a hundred fights to be able to
do it again; but you are tired, and I
will rouse the house."</p>

<p>So, hammering on the door, I soon
brought John Cotton to it. His woolly
hair almost went straight on seeing me,
and he started back, for he thought he
saw my ghost.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Mars Jim," he stammered,
"does that be you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you black scamp." And I
soon convinced him of my real personality.</p>

<p>"But, Mars Jim, who is dat you
got wid you? It ain't one of dem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Yankee ladies, is it?" For, I am
sorry to say, John Cotton did not approve
of the ladies in question, and
was afraid I would "disgrace de
family" if I married one of them.
Before I could answer I heard a glad
little cry, and there was my mother,
coming down the stairway of the great
hall.</p>

<p>"How is my little lady?" said I, as
I picked her up and kissed her, and
then I introduced Mistress Jean to
her and told her of our adventure at
the Braes.</p>

<p>Then my mother went up to her,
in her stately little way, and took her
hands in hers, and kissed and welcomed
her to the House of Fairlee.</p>

<p>So they made friends with each
other then and there, as women do,
and my mother led her away, up the
broad stairs, and I stood looking after
them. Then I turned to my own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
room, and, throwing myself on the
bed, I slept the sleep of exhaustion
for many hours.</p>

<p>When the hour of my awakening
came I sprang up, for there lay the
despatch which I was to bear to the
Council of Safety.</p>

<p>Drawing on my riding-boots and
buckling on my sword, I called John
Cotton to bring my horse to the door,
for several miles lay between Fairlee
and Rock Hall, where the boat lay to
take me to Annapolis.</p>

<p>I walked across to the hall and on
to the old porch, where I saw Mistress
Jean standing, gazing wistfully out on
the broad bay.</p>

<p>"He is safe now, Mistress Jean."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said with a sad smile,
"but when shall I ever see him
again?"</p>

<p>"Just as soon as we whip them," I
replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then it will never be," came her
retort.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! What will your uncle,
Captain Nicholson, say when he finds
he has such a fiery little Tory in his
house? He will have to give up chasing
the redcoats to suppress the Goddess
of Sedition in his own camp."</p>

<p>But at this Mistress Jean gave her
head a toss and walked away to the
end of the porch.</p>

<p>Then John Cotton brought the
horse to the steps.</p>

<p>"Are you going so soon, Mr.
Frisby?"</p>

<p>"I must," I answered; "I am a
bearer of despatches to the Council of
Safety. I would gladly desert my
trust to be your escort to Chestertown,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The honour of the House of
Fairlee stands in the way," said she
mockingly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not that, my lady," I replied,
bowing courteously, "but the fact that
I would fall even lower in your good
graces."</p>

<p>"Well said, cavalier," she retorted,
with a sweeping courtesy. "'Tis a
pity that so fine a gentleman should be
a rebel."</p>

<p>"Or so fair a maid a Tory."</p>

<p>"Is this a minuet?" came the
laughing voice of my mother from the
door.</p>

<p>"Nay, mother, I am only bidding
Mistress Jean good-bye with all due
ceremony."</p>

<p>A few moments later I was in the
saddle, trotting slowly off, while behind
me fluttered their handkerchiefs, waving
good-bye.</p>

<p>Rock Hall lies on a bluff, looking
out across the bay. To the southward
lies the Isle of Kent, with its fertile
fields of waving grain, and off there on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the horizon the greenish ribbon near
the sky line tells where the hills of
Anne Arundel lay.</p>

<p>Down below, under the bluff, lay a
long, slender boat, shaped like a canoe,
but much larger, stouter, stronger, and
far swifter, when the wind filled its sails
and carried it like a bird skimming over
the waters.</p>

<p>"An English man-of-war is lying off
the Isle of Kent now," said the old
waterman in answer to my question,
"but we can walk all around her in this
boat."</p>

<p>"Then we will start immediately," I
replied, and placing my things on board
we were soon under way.</p>

<p>The wind caught our sails; we stood
out into the bay gloriously, and she
fairly flew through the water. As we
rounded the Isle of Kent we saw, lying
almost in our track, the English man-of-war,
lazily rolling with the tide.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was a great bustle on
board, and the sailors flew to the rigging,
the sails filled with the wind, and
through the port hole was run the ugly
muzzle of a Long Tom. The waterman
with me laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"They think they can stop us," said
he, but he never altered his course.</p>

<p>So we bore down on her until there
came a flash; a cannon ball came ricochetting
across the water, but fell short
by a hundred yards.</p>

<p>The waterman chuckled. "That is
about the right distance," said he; and
the boat answering the helm, fairly
danced around his Majesty's representative,
always, by a saving grace, just
beyond cannon shot.</p>

<p>And when his Majesty's ship actually
gave chase and sent a broadside after
our impertinent piece of baggage the
waterman fairly danced with delight and
led her a merry chase down the bay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
until we were opposite Annapolis.
Then with a flirt of her sail we bade
them good-bye and ran for the mouth
of the Severn. Gaining that, we soon
passed the charred hulk of the Peggy
Stewart and ran up beside the wharf,
and I found myself walking the streets
of that gay little capital.</p>

<p>It was growing somewhat late, but I
made my way at once to the State
House, where the Convention of the
Freemen of the Province sat, hoping
still to find them at their deliberations.
I paused for the moment when I came
to the foot of the knoll on which the
State House stands, for it had only
recently been completed, and was the
noblest building in America. Its massive
proportions towered high above
me, overawing the town at its feet, and
commanding the country for miles
around. But it was not a time for halting.
Hurrying up the long flights of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
steps, I found myself in the great lobby,
with its lofty ceilings and its air of
vastness.</p>

<p>The Convention had adjourned but
a short time before, and the lobby was
still filled with men. As I threaded my
way through them my dusty uniform
and muddy boots marked me out as a
bearer of despatches.</p>

<p>"News from the army&mdash;victory or
defeat?" cried eager voices around me.
Answer them I would not, but hurried
on to the room where sat the Council
of Safety, who held the fate and the
fortunes of the province in its hand and
was the heart and soul of the great
revolt.</p>

<p>An usher stood at the door, but, seeing
my uniform, threw it wide open,
and, as I entered, softly swung it to
behind me. It was a lofty room in
which I found myself, with immense
windows looking out over the town and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the sweep of the waters of the bay to
the distant line of the eastern shore. A
long, broad table extended down the
centre of the room. Around it were
seated some sixteen or eighteen gentlemen.
Staid men and grave they were,
past the middle age of life, for the
younger men had gone to fight the battles
of the republic; men who were
fitted by experience to guide the province
through the stormy scenes of the
civil war.</p>

<p>At their head sat a venerable gentleman
whom I knew to be Matthew
Tilghman, the patriarch of the Colony.
At his right hand sat a man of sturdy
build, ruddy countenance, and dark hair
and eyes, more like a prosperous planter
with many acres and numerous slaves
than the man who was soon to become
the Great War Governor of Maryland.
All down the table on either side sat
men with strong, determined faces,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
whose names bespoke the chieftainship
of many a powerful family. A movement
of interest ran down the table as
I entered and delivered to the venerable
Chairman the despatch. He broke
the seal with nervous fingers, and then
rising, read General Washington's despatch
aloud amid intense interest.</p>

<p>"Battle," "defeat," "rout," "Cortelyou
House," "the Maryland Line."
"Good, I see the boys did their duty,"
were among the many exclamations I
heard around the table and when the
despatch ended.</p>

<p>"The bearer will describe the battle."</p>

<p>They all turned to me, and Thomas
Johnson said: "Come, young gentleman,
tell us everything you saw and
heard."</p>

<p>So I took my place by the Chairman
and told them of what I had seen and
done, amid many interruptions and
eager questions from the Council.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus for a time, as I stood there, I
became a man of importance, telling the
tale of the battle, of the defeat and the
rout, of the fiery charges, the death,
the pain and the anguish of it all, until
long after the night had fallen. But an
end comes to all things, and Thomas
Johnson, laying his hand on my shoulder,
said:</p>

<p>"Young gentleman, you must stay
with me to-night."</p>

<p>I accepted gladly, for the inns were
crowded, and it was somewhat late in
the evening to find a friend to take me
in. We strolled across the State House
grounds under the soft September skies,
through the wide, dusty streets, until we
came to the future Governor's house.
Though it was late, we talked for yet
another hour, and then, with a cheery
good-night, I was shown to my room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE VETO OF A MAID</h3>


<p>Ah, I am afraid the clean white
sheets, the soft springy bed, and the
balmy September air proved traitor to
me, after the hardships of a soldier's
life in the field, the rough bivouac, and
the hard ride from the North, for when
I awoke with a start, I found the sun
high in the heavens and the music of
birds coming through the open window
from the trees outside. Hurriedly
dressing, I opened my door and went
down the broad stairway into the old
hall. Everything was quiet, not a soul
was around. I wandered across the
hall and parlour, and there I stood for a
few minutes, looking out into the street,
when a merry burst of laughter across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the hall attracted my attention. The
door of the room opposite was slightly
ajar, and I saw that it was the library
of the house; so crossing the hall, I
gently rapped on the panel. A cheery
"Come in!" was my answer. I obeyed
the summons, threw the door open, and
entered.</p>

<p>"Why, it is our feather-bed soldier,"
came a merry voice from the broad
window-sill, where sat two young ladies.
A peal of ringing laughter followed;
for, indeed, I was somewhat non-plussed
to thus come upon two such
laughing, merry girls.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One was dark, the other fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both were sweet and debonair.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Indeed they were very pretty, sitting
there amid the quaint old surroundings,
the heavy old book-presses, with solid
oak doors, the wainscoting extending
to the ceiling, the broad window-seats,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the green trees, and quiet garden beyond.
I knew at once that they must
be daughters of my host, Mistress
Polly and Mistress Betsy Johnson, at
that time the reigning belles of the
western shore.</p>

<p>"Now I know what awaited me I
shall never forgive that feather-bed,"
I replied, recovering from my confusion
and making my best bow. "I would
never have proved such a traitor to my
cloth."</p>

<p>"That is better," said Mistress Polly,
the black-haired, dark-eyed one. "Come
and report to us, sir. Do you not know
that no officer returns from the army
who does not immediately report to us?"</p>

<p>"I understand their alacrity in doing
so. I shall be among the first to obey
the order hereafter."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, come tell us of the battle,
and what brought you hither so fast
that the mud is still upon your boots?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, telling the account of the battle
to two charming young ladies, whose
bright eyes and eager faces told of the
interest they took in my narrative, was
a far different thing from telling the
same tale before the powerful Council
of Safety, and I am free to confess that
I enjoyed the last far more than the
first.</p>

<p>Their exclamations and excited questions
spurred me on, and I drew the
picture of the battle with a stronger
hand and painted myself a hero, which
I am afraid I was far from being.</p>

<p>But Mistress Betsy suddenly sat up
straight, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Bless me, Polly, Mr. Frisby has not
had his breakfast, and here it is near ten
o'clock"&mdash;an outrageous late hour in
those days.</p>

<p>At this both Mistress Polly and Mistress
Betsy sprang to their feet, and I
was duly conducted to the dining-room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
where a delightful breakfast awaited me,
which I endeavoured to eat amid their
sallies and their questioning.</p>

<p>We were having a very gay time of it,
when there came a heavy step through
the hall into the room, and a cheery
voice asked: "How is the soldier to-day?
In good hands, I see." It was
Thomas Johnson.</p>

<p>"That he is, sir," I replied, rising,
"and he thoroughly enjoys it too."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a soldier," replied our
future Governor, "and like a soldier you
must leave at once, for the Council desire
you to carry these despatches posthaste
to General Washington."</p>

<p>"No; he shall not," cried Mistress
Polly, with a stamp of her foot. "He
has promised to drive our four-in-hand
to the races this afternoon, and I am not
going to let that Council of old fogies
rob us of the only soldier in town who
has seen service for at least one day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"So that is the way the wind blows,"
said her father, pinching her cheek and
laughing. "I will tell the great Council
of Public Safety that they have been
overruled by a maid."</p>

<p>"It will not be the first time," she
retorted. "Their wives overrule them
every day."</p>

<p>"I will ride all night to make it up,"
I suggested.</p>

<p>"Never mind, my boy," he replied,
"you deserve a little holiday; you need
not leave Annapolis until nightfall, and
Kent the following night, which will
give you a chance to see your mother
again. There, I hope this little minx
will give me some peace now."</p>

<p>The treaty was quickly sealed by a
kiss, and Mistress Polly ran off to give
the order for the coach-and-four, for the
races began at one o'clock and the course
was a short distance out of the city.</p>

<p>There soon came a clatter of hoofs, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
rattle, a slam and a bang, a whoaing, a
yelling, and a confusion of noises.</p>

<p>"They have put the colts in," cried
Mistress Betsy with glee, and Mistress
Polly was at the door crying, "Come
on."</p>

<p>"Great Jove!" said I to myself, as I
seized my hat and followed after, for
though I had driven many a wild team
I had never done so through a town
before. And four devils they were for
a certainty, a little under size, but making
up for that by the fire and vim of
their proceedings.</p>

<p>The heels of the wheelers were playing
like castanets on the dashboard,
while the leaders were in the air half
the time as they swayed above the crowd
of darkies, who, hanging on everywhere,
were trying to hold them down, while
the great coach swayed and rocked
behind.</p>

<p>There was a flash of skirts, a gleam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of the smallest feet in the world, and
Mistress Polly and Mistress Betsy were
in their places, and I had sprung to my
seat and gathered the reins in my hands.</p>

<p>"All ready, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Ready. Let go." They scattered
like chaff. There was a flash of hoofs
and they were off like a shot, their
bodies stretched low to the ground, the
great coach rolling and rocking behind.</p>

<p>Luckily the street ended in a country
road, for the street and the houses were
gone in an instant, and we were rushing
along between green fields. A column
of dust rose up and whirled behind us,
and the road stretched like a ribbon
before, while the young ladies at my
side laughed and clapped their hands
in glee. After several miles the pace
began to tell, I slowly brought them
under control, and by the time I had
come to the race-course I had them well
in hand. We had gone several miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
out of our way, but by taking a short
cut we arrived at the races on time. I
brought the four colts into the field
with a dash and a flourish as they were
preparing for the first race.</p>

<p>The course was a great level field of
greensward, oval in shape, with the
track in beautiful condition. Far down
the track on either hand, almost encircling
the field, stretched the lines
of the coaches, chariots, gigs, and
wagons. Gentlemen on horseback and
on foot, an eager, bustling crowd, gay
with colours and bright faces, already
tingling with the excitement of the
coming race, made a stirring scene;
for the Trinity of the Marylanders
in the early days of my youth were
the horse, the hounds, and a fight.</p>

<p>But though the faces were fair,
merry, and pleasant to look upon,
though the chariots and four-in-hands
were gorgeous and bedecked, there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
a woful lack of cavaliers to make those
damask cheeks mantle with a blush, for
they were away fighting in the North.
Thus it was, as I drove down the line
in my uniform of scarlet and buff, to
find a stand, that Mistress Polly and
Mistress Betsy had their triumph, and
many a fair face turned our way as we
drove by, until I brought the coach to
a halt in a good place next to the parson,
where he sat his cob, watching the
preliminaries.</p>

<p>"Find the parson," said Mistress
Polly judiciously, "and you will have
found the best place in the field."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mistress Polly, you are a
minx," said that reverend gentleman.
"How in the world could I make the
youngsters come to church if they did
not know I was a good judge of horseflesh
as well as a minister?"</p>

<p>"They are off," cried Mistress Betsy.
The race had begun; but why describe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the race? Those who have never seen
a race are mere worthless creatures
deserving no consideration, and those
who have seen a race do not need a
description. At the mere name they
see the grand thoroughbreds at the line,
their coats shining like satin in the sun,
eager and ready to be off. Then the
flag falls, and, amid the rustling of skirts
and craning of necks, they are off. Ah,
and then comes the glorious excitement
of it all as you watch with eager eyes
that ribbon of a track, and see now this
one, now that one, slowly draw away
from the bunch at the start, and the
closing of the space again, until they
become mere moving spots on the far
side of the field. And then, that home
stretch, with its thunder of hoofs, its
roar of voices, and cheers and yells, as
the grand beasts, with straining nerves
and neck to neck, make the last great
effort; and afterward the triumph, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
waving of handkerchiefs, the great cheer
that greets the victor, and the smiles of
merry lips and laughing eyes. Those
were the prizes we raced for, when
racing was the pastime of gentlemen,
and not an excuse for blackguardism
and gambling, as to-day it is fast becoming.
So my kind hosts and I
made our little bets, and enjoyed ourselves
right thoroughly, until the last
race, which was won by a grandson of
the great Selim, was over and done.
Then I swung my four colts into the
road again, and at a rattling pace
returned to town.</p>

<p>It was late now, and the sun was
preparing to take its last dip behind
the western hills; so I was forced to
bid my charming hostesses adieu, and
amid many good wishes and a waving
of handkerchiefs, departed to seek my
waterman, to begin my trip across the
bay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>The town became a blur, a dark
mass behind us, broken by the twinkling
of the lights through the gloom,
as we swiftly glided down the Severn
before the wind. Out upon the bay it
was still light, and we steered for the
north point of the Isle of Kent. The
wind was fresh. With all sail set we
skimmed the water before it, and ere
many hours had passed we saw the
light through the gloom of Rock Hall
straight ahead. But the old waterman
suddenly brought his helm around
hard, and pointed her nose for the wide
mouth of the Chester close at hand.</p>

<p>"What is wrong?" I asked, and for
an answer he pointed with his arm to
where against the sky were outlined the
tapering masts of a large vessel lying
between us and Rock Hall.</p>

<p>"That is a man-of-war," he said,
"we will have to run up the river to
Chestertown."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Agreed," said I, right readily, for I
thought I might see Mistress Jean
once more before I went back to the
front.</p>

<p>The mouth of the Chester was soon
gained, and for hours, through the
stillness of the night, we glided over its
smooth waters, between low, heavily
wooded banks, or the broad sweeping
fields of some plantation, whose boundaries
were lapped by the waters of the
river. In the early morning, in the
dusky gray hours, we ran along beside
the wharf of the old county seat of
Kent.</p>

<h3>THE GREETING OF FAIR LIPS</h3>


<p>After wandering through the streets
of this old town during the early hours
of the morning, seeing it gradually
wake into life and take on the quiet
bustle of the day, I at last found myself
before the inn, which had just been
opened.</p>

<p>The host was an old friend, and we
were soon fighting over the battles
again, when a shadow fell across us
and I sprang to my feet.</p>

<p>It was Capt. James Nicholson, one
of the three brothers who fought their
ships in sunshine and in storm, while
there was a plank left for them to stand
upon, carrying dismay through the
English fleets by their desperate courage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and daring. He was a man about
forty years old, over medium height,
but slender and of fair complexion, with
light blue eyes and reddish hair, a typical
descendant of that old Viking,
Nicholson, who fought some famous
fights under King Haco, and harried
the coasts of Scotland until he gained a
foothold there and founded the Scottish
family of the name. The same open,
bold countenance of the Admiral, the
same frank and manly bearing, showed
him to be a sailor and a fighter.</p>

<p>"Hello, Frisby," said he, shaking
my hand cordially. "With the dove
so near I knew that the hawk would
not be far away."</p>

<p>I stammered out, as the landlord
smiled, that I was forced to come to
Chestertown to avoid the man-of-war
lying off Rock Hall.</p>

<p>"She is off Rock Hall, is she? Well,
I shall have to chase her away with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Defence next week. But is that your
only excuse for coming so far out of
your way?"</p>

<p>And when I protested that it was, he
laughed genially, and, turning to the
landlord, said: "He does not look like
a knight-errant who flies to the rescue
of maids, and Tory maids at that, does
he? But see here, youngster, since you
have brought this little traitress into
my household, you will have to do your
share in converting her to the true
principles of liberty and democracy."</p>

<p>"Keep that for the men, Captain,"
cried the landlord. "Keep that for the
men; the women give us no peace, as
it is, and if they once get those notions
there will be no living with them."</p>

<p>"Ah, you old reprobate, you had
better not let your wife hear you."</p>

<p>With this we left the inn, and going
through some quiet streets, we at last
came to Water Street, with its square<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
brick houses, gardens and flowers, and
green lawns leading to the river. Very
substantial were the buildings, quaint
and old-fashioned. A number of white
steps led from the street to the porch
of the Captain's house. When, at his
motion, I opened the door and stepped
into the hall, which was somewhat dark
after the glare of the street, there came
a flurry of lace, and soft arms were
around my neck. And&mdash;well, what
could a man do but return that kiss
with interest? But the best things are
but fleeting, for, when she glanced at
my face, and saw who I was, she gave
a little cry, broke from my arms, and
vanished in confusion up the stairway,
followed by the merry laughter of the
real uncle, not the proxy.</p>

<p>"You surely cannot object to that
welcome, Frisby; but I must tell Mistress
Jean to be more careful, or the
army will lose a promising officer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
They will not be able to keep you away
from the town if this keeps on."</p>

<p>So saying, he led the way to the rear
porch where it overlooked the lawn and
the river.</p>

<p>Here we sat and talked until the
breakfast-bell rang, and we went into
the dining-room. I was as hungry as
a trooper by this time, after my all-night
experience on the Chester.</p>

<p>The dining-room was a long room,
with open windows looking out across
the river and the fields.</p>

<p>We had not as yet taken our seats,
when through another door came Mistress
Jean and Mistress Nancy Nicholson,
her bosom friend and confidante,
with their arms around each other's
waists&mdash;a charming picture.</p>

<p>The colour mantled high on Mistress
Jean's cheek, and I am sure that mine
played the traitor also, but Mistress
Nancy came to the rescue by demanding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
news and particulars of her cavalier,
for such she declared Mr. Richard
Ringgold of Hunting Field to be.</p>

<p>Answering, I told her that I had left
him covered with blood and with glory,
but on the fair road to recovery. And
so, though Mistress Jean still showed
a heightened colour, in telling of Master
Richard's fortunes and escapes we broke
the embarrassment of the meeting, and
were soon fast friends again. It was a
merry breakfast. Afterward the two
young ladies and I walked in the garden
by the river's edge and talked of
many things,&mdash;of war and campaigning,
for I claimed to be an authority by
now, and quite a veteran,&mdash;of love;
but that was too dangerous, for Mistress
Nancy would look at me slyly and
laugh as she asked if I was as great an
authority upon the one as I was upon
the other.</p>

<p>I retorted that I had heard many a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
lecture on the subject from Master
Richard, but otherwise knew nothing
of the art, and then I begged her to
take me as a pupil, so that in time I
might become as great a scholar as
Dick himself. But she roguishly recommended
me to her Assistant Professor
Mistress Jean Gordon, who, she
told me, knew more of the art than she
did herself. And then, having come
to some boxwood alleys, she slipped
away and left Mistress Jean and me
alone.</p>

<p>"They tell me, Mistress Jean, that
love is war; may I ask what the fate
of the prisoners is?"</p>

<p>"As in real war," she replied,
"those who surrender at discretion
receive but scant courtesy, but those
who make a gallant resistance are often
victorious in their defeat."</p>

<p>"I see that you love the old Highland
fashion, where the bridegroom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
came with force and arms and bore the
bride away."</p>

<p>"Better swords and daggers, and
hearts that are true, than silks and
satins, Lowland fops and perfidy."</p>

<p>"English swords have crossed ere this
with Highland steel, and English hearts
are as tried and as true as those that beat
beneath the plaid," said I, coming to
the defence of my English ancestry.</p>

<p>"So ho! Sir Rebel!" she cried in
glee, "what means this defence of the
hated redcoat? Do you not fear the
shadow of the great committee that
you preach treason so openly?" And
she looked so bewitching in her little
triumph that I had to thrust my hands
into my pockets and turn away, so
great was the temptation.</p>

<p>"I will turn Highlander," said I,
"if you do not stop."</p>

<p>"Stop?" she said with the most innocent
air in the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye," said I, "for if your Highlanders
have ever been sturdy knaves,
the Frisbys have ever been quick where
bright eyes and ruby lips are concerned,
and there is no telling what might happen."
And I looked so determined
and fierce that she broke into merry
laughter in my face.</p>

<p>"Your fate be upon you," said I
solemnly; and&mdash;well, at that moment,
I heard Captain Nicholson calling that
my horse was at the door, waiting for
me.</p>

<p>"That means that I must go, Mistress
Jean," and the laughter died on
her lips, "go to join my comrades in
the North in their struggle for the
Great Cause. When you hear of battles
and sieges and sudden deaths, will
you sometimes think of the young
rebel who rode with you from the
Braes to Fairlee? For wherever he
may be, whether in the glory of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
rush and the sweep of the charge, or
the gloomy and dismal retreat; whether
in the camp on the bleak hillside,
with the cold north wind blowing, or
bivouacked in the Southern savannahs
warmed by the rays of the sun; in the
fatigue and the toil of the marches, amid
the groans and cries of the dying, or
the joy and triumph of the hour when
the fight has been fought and won,
your smile shall always be with him,
the light of your eye in his heart.
Will you think of him, or forget, Mistress
Jean?"</p>

<p>"I will think of him." Her voice
was very low and sweet. Then I
stooped and kissed her hand, the fairest
hand that man ever looked upon.</p>

<h3>THE RETURN OF THE TORY</h3>


<p>As I turned to ride away, after bidding
good-bye to the Captain, I heard
a voice calling me, and looking up, I
saw Mistress Nancy at a window, and
riding under it she commanded me to
convey to Master Richard a tiny case
wrapped in many papers.</p>

<p>"And now, sir," said she, "here is
something for you;" and she threw
me a little case, which, on opening
quickly, I saw contained a miniature
of a fair young girl, with a wealth of
dark brown hair, the loveliest eyes and
the sweetest face.</p>

<p>"Mistress Nancy," I cried, "you
are my guardian angel." Placing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
miniature over my heart, I threw her a
kiss, and rode on my way rejoicing.</p>

<p>I rode from Chestertown to Fairlee,
where I bade my mother good-bye, and
from there I took up the trail to the
North, riding into camp one evening
just as the sun was setting.</p>

<p>I reported immediately to the great
General, who thanked me for the speed
with which I had carried the despatches
and returned. And then I was once more
among my old comrades of the Line.</p>

<p>They crowded around me, one and
all, for I had messages for many of
them, and they were eager for the news
of old Kent and the shore, and my
welcome was right royal.</p>

<p>And now, for a month or so, disasters
came crowding upon our arms; defeat
and death stalked through our ranks,
and cast a gloom over the cause.</p>

<p>We fought the fight at White Plains,
and when Fort Washington fell many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of our Maryland boys went to the
hulks of old Jersey to find a last resting-place
under the cold gray waters of
Wallabout Bay. Amid constant marching,
skirmishes, and defeats the months
slipped away, and the cold gloomy winter
was upon us. Ah, how cold and
bleak and barren the hillsides looked
after the smiling fields of Maryland,
touched and warmed by the Southern
sun! And then the cold, the bitter
cold of it all, the white winding sheet
of the snow and the ice made us shiver
and hug the fire of dry fence-rails and
button our threadbare coats more
tightly around us, while we looked in
despair at the toes peeping through the
ends of our boots. But the great General
knew how to warm the blood in our
veins and drive the despair from our
hearts, when on that bitterly cold Christmas
night he led us across the Delaware
and hurled us against the Hessians.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true that we left a trail of blood
as we marched, dyeing the snow with
its crimson. Yet the fight itself was
glorious, and when we came back in
our triumph the cold and the snow were
as nothing. We made sport of our rags
and tatters and laughed the English to
scorn.</p>

<p>Then again when we struck them at
Princeton seven days later, threw the
dust in Cornwallis's eyes, and played
with him as we willed, we were ready
to follow our leader wherever he pointed
the way.</p>

<p>And so, after humbling the English,
we returned to our camp for the winter,
and there made ready for the spring,
when we saw my Lord Cornwallis back
on the Hudson again.</p>

<p>Then we lay in Jersey, watching
them over in New York, until far into
the summer, ready to take up the
march when the news should come of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the destination of the English fleet that
lay off Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>At last one day there came a horseman
spurring fast from the southward,
bearing the news of a vast fleet that
covered the waves of the Chesapeake
and lay at that moment off the harbor
of Baltimore, threatening it with fire and
sword.</p>

<p>Then there was a mighty bustle in
the camp, and we whose homes were
now in danger took up the march to
the southward, eager to meet the foe.</p>

<p>When we reached Philadelphia we
found that the enemy had entered the
Elk, and was now marching on the city,
while the hastily called Maryland and
Delaware volunteers threw themselves
in the way, cutting off straggling parties
and obstructing the advance.</p>

<p>So we hurried on to assist them, and
found ourselves on the evening of the
10th of September at the Brandywine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
with the English advance but a few
miles away.</p>

<p>It was here that I met with one of
the volunteers, who on hearing the
English were in the Chesapeake had
taken his rifle from the rack and joined
in the defence. He came from lower
Kent, but told me of the devastation all
through the county of Cecil, wherever
the enemy had laid its blighting hand.</p>

<p>"They tell me," he said, "that the
old Tory, Charles Gordon, whom they
ran out of Cecil, is with Lord Howe,
and high in his counsels. When they
arrived in the Elk, Gordon, with a
body of troops, marched all night and
attacked the house of James Rodolph
at dawn. Rodolph was away from
home, and that is the only thing that
saved him, for they say that Gordon
swore that he would hang him if he
once caught him. As it was, he gave
Rodolph's house to the flames, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
burned everything on the place. 'An
eye for an eye,' said he, 'is a Highland
saying as well as a Jewish one. I
regret that I cannot destroy the land as
well.' Rodolph, when he heard of it,
stormed and swore, but he has not
dared to venture within the confines of
Cecil since."</p>

<p>"Did Gordon do anything else?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"No. After he burnt Rodolph out
he tried to stop Lord Howe from pillaging,
but his lordship answered, 'You
have had your turn, and now you must
let the others have theirs,' and so the
pillaging went on."</p>

<p>But the planters and the yeomen
who had risen at the first alarm hung
on the flanks of Lord Howe's army,
cutting off stragglers and scouting-parties,
and confining the belt of desolation
within narrow lines.</p>

<p>At last came the 11th of September,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the day when we met Lord Howe at
the Brandywine, and were sent reeling
back in disorderly retreat, when by a
skilful march they outflanked our right
wing and rolled it up.</p>

<p>And then disaster followed disaster.
Paoli came, that grim and bloody surprise
at the dead of night. We had
marched with Wayne and gained the
rear of the British column, and lay for
the night in a dense wood, waiting for
the recruits under Smallwood, who was
marching to join us, before we began
our attack on the British rear.</p>

<p>It was in the early hours of the
morning, the blackest of the night, the
hour before the dawn, when there came
sudden shots from our pickets, and
before we could spring to arms the
Highland war-cry rang through the
forest and the Black Watch swept over
us. The wild forms of the Highlanders,
the intense darkness, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>surprise,
the din and noise of the strife as
those who could grasp their muskets
made a desperate stand, struck terror
through the camp, and ere the men
could rally we were swept into the
woods beyond. It seemed to me, as I
was borne along in the press, I heard,
high over the charging cry of the Scots,
the voice of the old Tory cheering his
men on. Certain it is that I saw him
for a moment by the light of a camp-fire,
sword in hand, urging on his wild
Scots, who seemed to grow wilder under
his leadership, as our line melted away
before their advance.</p>

<p>Ah! but it was grim and terrible.
Our men, overcome by the surprise
and the rout, carried terror into the
camp of Smallwood's recruits, which was
near at hand, and they, too, gave way.</p>

<p>But the dawn came: with it we gathered
our shattered forces together and
marched back to join Washington.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Philadelphia fell, but the tide soon
turned; for at Germantown we once
more met them and avenged the surprise
at Paoli.</p>

<p>But the thing that thrilled us through
and through and set our banners high
was the courage of our brothers of the
Line, who, thrown into Fort Mifflin,
held it in the teeth of the enemy's fire
until every gun was dismounted and the
fort itself levelled to the earth, leaving
nothing to defend. It was a brave and
gallant action, and we envied them for
their good fortune.</p>

<p>We had avenged Paoli at Germantown,
yet this added another wreath to
our banner. It was a thing to stir the
blood and to set the pulses bounding
to hear how those heroes fought under
the crumbling walls of Mifflin, and
prayed for the friendly cover of night
to fall to hide them from that storm of
fire and shell, and yet fought on.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>THE FLAG OF TRUCE</h3>


<p>The long hard winter soon came on,
and we retired to Valley Forge to suffer
and to bear what was far more deadly
than the English bullets&mdash;the terrible
cold and desolation of that dreary place.
Cold, bitterly cold it was, as the wind
came down from the mountains, swept
over the broad fields, pierced through
our torn and tattered garments, and
racked our frames with pain. And yet,
terrible as the exposure was, there
stands out one bright day in all that
dreary winter, one day, one hour in
which I forgot all the cold and the
hardships and would not have been
elsewhere for anything in the wide
world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>It was near the setting of the sun on
one of the bleakest and coldest days of
the year. The sun itself was sinking
behind the distant hills, and the sky
was brilliant with its fiery javelins,
which threw a lurid light across the
cold gray heavens, the last protest of
departing day against the approach of
the chill dismal night. The snow lay
heavy upon the ground, and spread
like a great white pall over the sins and
sorrows of the world. Before us stretched
the road, unbroken and trackless; not a
man had passed that way, for we stood
guard at the outpost, and the flicker of
the foeman's fire could be seen six hundred
yards away, through the gloom.</p>

<p>"Lucifer, but it is cold!" said one
of the guard, as he threw another rail
on the fire and held his hands out over
the flames to warm them.</p>

<p>"Aye; Old Nick himself would not
be a bad acquaintance now&mdash;his smell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
of brimstone and sulphur might warm
us up a bit," said another.</p>

<p>We were making the best we could
of it, under the lee of a high bank by
the side of the road, where we had
cleared a space and stacked a good
supply of dry fence-rails to feed the
fire during the night. The wind from
the northwest swept over our heads,
sheltered as we were by the bank, and
we would have defied the cold that
crept ever upward but for the rags and
tatters that covered our frames. The
men themselves were cheerful, as they
sat hugging the fire, and laughed and
joked at their hardships.</p>

<p>"I wonder if those Highland devils
will bother us to-night?" asked one,
for the Black Watch held the outpost
down the road.</p>

<p>"They will be too busy warming
their knees," came the reply from
across the fire, and a laugh followed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, what is that?" for the thud
of hoofs was heard on the road coming
from the camp.</p>

<p>"A flag of truce, by George!" said
the sergeant. "Who on earth wants
to go through the lines on a night like
this?"</p>

<p>The party, consisting of several
troopers, an officer, and what appeared
to be a woman on horseback, was soon
within hailing distance, and I heard
Ringgold's voice call out:</p>

<p>"I say, Frisby, are you in charge
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied. "What's up?"</p>

<p>"We have a prisoner here who wishes
to go through the lines, but I don't
know whether you will permit her or
not."</p>

<p>"Is she fair?" I asked. "For in
that case she shall not pass unless she
gives us a smile by way of tribute as
she rides by."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not even if George Washington
so orders, sir," said a voice that I
knew.</p>

<p>"By the saints, my lady!" I cried,
and I was by her side in an instant.
"What brings you here, and why
are you going within the English
lines?"</p>

<p>"Should not a daughter be with her
father?" she asked.</p>

<p>"But those bloody English, with all
their fine trappings and their feathers!
Nay, my lady, you have been disrespectful
to the Continental Congress,
as I can vouch for. You are our prisoner,
and I will not let you escape thus,
to smile on the wearers of his Majesty's
uniform."</p>

<p>But she laughed quite merrily, and
answered my threat with "Lieutenant
Ringgold, pray ride on with the flag
of truce."</p>

<p>"Dick Ringgold," I cried in my turn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
"if you take less than ten minutes I
shall be your deadly enemy for life."</p>

<p>"All right, old fellow." Dick rode
on toward the enemy's campfire with
the bugler until he had gone about half
the way, and then we heard the parley
sounded and saw a stir in the opposite
camp.</p>

<p>"Mistress Jean," said I, returning to
the charge, "you are perfectly heartless,
and though I know the redcoats cannot
help but fall in love with you, I warn
you that if you smile on any one of
them I shall go through the lines and
seek him out, even into the heart of the
city itself, though I have to swing for
it."</p>

<p>"You will never try anything so
rash;" and now the laughter had gone
from her voice.</p>

<p>"That I will, my lady," I replied, "for
I would rather dance on nothing than
know that you belonged to another."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you must not," said she.
"You must not think of such a thing.
You must promise me never to attempt
it."</p>

<p>"Nay, Mistress Jean, that I cannot
promise. It would drive me mad to
stand here on guard all the winter
night and see the lights of Philadelphia
off there in the east; to know
amid all the gayety and the balls
you reign supreme; to know I could
not see you because of the miserable
redcoats that guard the city. If they
were ten times their number I would
find my way through them to be once
more at your side, Mistress Jean."</p>

<p>Before she could reply the Highland
officer broke in, for he had ridden up
with Ringgold.</p>

<p>"Mistress Jean, it gives me pleasure
to be the first to welcome you to our
lines. Your father told us of your coming,
and there has been a rivalry between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
us as to who should be the one to escort
you to the city."</p>

<p>"That was kind of all of you; but
how did you leave my father?"</p>

<p>"Well, and eager for your coming."</p>

<p>He was a splendid-looking young
fellow, tall, broad-shouldered, and somewhat
bony, with a voice that rang frank
and true. He was a Highlander, every
inch of him, and carried himself with a
free and graceful carriage, and when I
heard him tell Mistress Jean that he
was a Farquharson and an old ally of
her house, I knew I had at last met a
dangerous rival. For, out of romances,
it is not the villain, but the brave and
frank gentleman who is most dangerous
to the peace of mind of lovers, for they
see in him what they themselves most
admire, and by which they hope to win
their ladies' love.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Ringgold, now," said
Farquharson, "I am ready to receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Mistress Gordon from your hands, and
to conduct her within our lines."</p>

<p>"Far more ready than we are to let
her go," answered Dick gallantly; "but
it is the fortune of war." And then the
two officers saluted and the exchange
was made.</p>

<p>So Mistress Jean bade us all good-bye
right prettily, and I, being on the off
side of her horse from the others, seized
her hand as it hung by her side and
kissed it several times. She at first did
not withdraw it, and then, bending over,
whispered, "Do not try to enter the
city, for they will hang thee, and I would
not lose so true a friend." Here her
voice was very soft and low. I kissed
her hand once again and she was
gone.</p>

<p>We watched their dark shadows down
the road to the Highland outpost, as
they moved like great blots across the
snow. I stood, I do not know how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
long, gazing after them, when Dick's
hand was on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Frisby," said he, "we
shall win the city in the spring, and then
you may win her also."</p>

<h3>THE BALL OF MY LORD HOWE</h3>


<p>Many a night after that last parting
I stood guard on that dreary outpost,
gazing out across the snow at the dim
lights of the city far to the eastward.
Aye, for the city was gay that winter,
gay with parties and dances, balls and
dinners, and the bells rang as merrily
as if we were not starving and dying
out on the bleak, hillsides. Aye, those
old burghers were warm and comfortable
as they sat by their fires, with a glass
of their wine or toddy at their side.</p>

<p>True, my Lord Howe ruled the city
with an iron hand, but he was a gallant
gentleman, and his officers made good
partners for their fair daughters at the
balls. They were handsome in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
scarlet uniforms, with their epaulets and
their sabres, making, indeed, a very gallant
show, while those ragged patriots
out upon the snow had not shoes to their
feet, and were altogether too disreputable
to be admitted even to the kitchens
of their houses. Then, again, runs
not the Quaker law, "Thou shalt not
fight"? And so the good old burghers
threw another log on the fire and sat
down to enjoy the cheerful blaze.</p>

<p>The news came to us, sifted through
the lines; we heard of their dances and
their balls, and everywhere we heard
that Mistress Jean Gordon was the belle
of them all. The old Tory held high
rank in the counsels of Lord Howe,
and the daughter, by her grace and
beauty, reigned it over the hearts of
every gallant gentleman of his army.</p>

<p>We heard of her refusing my Lord
Paulet and several other gentlemen,
noted among us for their hard fighting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
whenever by chance we were opposed
to them. And I, standing guard on the
outpost, chafed in vain when I heard
these tales, until one day chance decided
me to risk all, to see her once more
with my own eyes, and perhaps speak
to her.</p>

<p>There had been a skirmish on the
outposts that day, and our men had
captured an English officer, a Captain
of the line. He was a talkative man,
and while he was waiting to be sent to
the rear as a prisoner we entertained
him at our mess table, and he in turn
told us the news of the town.</p>

<p>"That must be a wonderful country,
what do you call it, that eastern shore
of yours?" said he, "if it contains
any more beauties like Mistress Jean
Gordon."</p>

<p>"Ah, the Tory's daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She is the reigning belle of the
whole town, and all our fellows are wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
about her. I never saw so many fellows
in love with one girl before, but Farquharson
seems to have the best of it,
while Lord Paulet stamps and swears."</p>

<p>Now, we were loyal Marylanders&mdash;loyal,
at least, to her wit and beauty, so
then and there we proposed and drank
the health of the Tory maid, while Dick
chimed in with the amendment, "May
she never marry a Britisher, but a patriot
tried and true," at which our English
Captain good-naturedly protested; and
while they drank the toast I made a
vow that ere a week was past I would
be within that city.</p>

<p>Fortune came my way, for as I left
the mess-room that night I ran against
Tom Jones of Cresap's old company
of riflemen from the mountains of the
West, the most daring and desperate
spy in all our army. He was a man of
powerful strength, as lithe and active as
a panther, while his face was as immovable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
as that of an Indian, with never a
sign thereon of the thoughts and passions
of the man within. He was clad
for the moment in the dress of the riflemen,
a full suit of buckskin, leggings,
hunting-shirt, and all, while carelessly
thrown across one arm was his rifle, and
in his belt was sheathed the long hunting-knife.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," said he, "I expect to
return through your lines to-morrow
night, so do not fire before you challenge."</p>

<p>"Come this way, Jones," said I,
leading him aside from the others. "I
do not know which way you are going,
but I want you to help me through the
lines into the city. Can you do so?"</p>

<p>"But, Lieutenant, they will be wanting
to hang you if you are caught."</p>

<p>"I will take that risk. I must be in
the city within a week."</p>

<p>Jones, like most great frontiersmen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
was a man of quick decision and few
words.</p>

<p>"Meet me in an hour," said he, "at
the Yellow Tavern."</p>

<p>An hour later found me at the tavern
in full uniform, for it was the only suit
I possessed in which it would be possible
to present myself before a lady, so
dilapidated, torn, and ragged was my
wardrobe. But I had a great storm-coat
which hid the uniform and was an
admirable disguise.</p>

<p>The tavern was crowded. As I
stood by the fire I did not at once notice
a quiet, unassuming traveller who
had just entered, until he brushed past
my arm and whispered, "Follow me."
I did so a few minutes later, for it was
Tom Jones, who looked for all the
world as if he was a quiet city merchant,
born and bred within its limits. Yet
you had but to notice his walk, and you
saw at once that he was a mountaineer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
for he threaded his way through the
crowd as noiselessly as he did among
his native forests, where the crack of a
dead twig might mean his death by a
hostile bullet.</p>

<p>I followed him out into the night,
and a dark and dismal night it was;
the snow was falling heavily and you
could not see three rods away.</p>

<p>"We will follow the pike," said he,
"until we see their camp-fire. They
will not keep strict watch to-night, and
we will have to keep in touch with the
landmarks."</p>

<p>We trudged along through the snow
past the outpost where I had commanded
so many nights, keeping the
vigils by the weary hours; then we
became more careful, as the Highland
outpost was but a few yards away.</p>

<p>"They will have their backs to the
storm," said the spy, "and though it is
dangerous to go to the windward of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
foe, yet he is not so apt to hear us as
he would be to see us if we tried the
leeward side. Those Highlanders have
keen eyes."</p>

<p>So we flanked the outpost to the
windward and passed them safely, and
then Jones led me by many little bypaths
and lanes until we came to the
outskirts of the town. And though the
guard at one time could have touched
us as they passed, so dense was the
storm that never for a moment was our
safety jeoparded.</p>

<p>At last the houses became closer and
we found ourselves in the town, while
every now and then a belated traveller
met us, glanced our way and passed on,
for by now it was far into the night.
But when we reached the heart of the
town, even at that hour, the streets
became filled with carriages, and we met
many officers and gentlemen, returning
from a ball. My Lord Howe entertained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
that night, and it was a sign of
loyalty and good faith for every one to
attend.</p>

<p>Though I became interested in seeing
the muffled figures pass us, and the carriages
hurrying through the street, I
grew uneasy as I saw that Jones was
making his way to the centre of the
town, to the very door of Lord Howe's
mansion. At last I remonstrated with
him, but Jones growled in answer:
"How can you throw the dogs off your
track, if the snow does not fill it, but by
mixing it with other tracks?"</p>

<p>This was unanswerable. I followed
him along the street until we were among
the crowd before Lord Howe's door.</p>

<p>It was a gay and brilliant scene, that
ball of my Lord Howe, and though it
was near the end, the music of the dance
still floated through the wide entrance,
while the figures of the dancers flitted
across the windows, which were ablaze<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
with lights. The guests were fast leaving;
fair ladies and officers bravely uniformed
were coming down the steps.
There was a calling of carriages and of
names, the slamming of doors and the
muffled roll of the wheels as they drove
off. I was about to move on with
Jones, when I heard the major-domo, a
sergeant of the guard, call out the carriage
of Colonel Charles Gordon, and then
I would have drawn back, as I had been
forced into the front rank; for, though
I knew that she must be at the ball, I
had not thought to be brought so suddenly
face to face with her. But ere I
could do so, she came down the carpeted
stairs leaning on her father's arm,
graceful and beautiful, while by her side
walked Farquharson in full Highland
costume, eager and attentive. A smile
was upon her lips as she listened, and
then her eyes met mine. Her face went
pale, and she was near fainting. Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
father caught her as she slightly reeled,
and Farquharson looked fiercely around
to see what the cause was. But I was
muffled up, and before he could demand
the cause Mistress Jean was eagerly
declaring that it was a mere nothing;
and, as if to prove what she said was
true, she hurried on to the carriage.</p>

<p>Farquharson leaned for a moment
into the carriage to bid them good-night,
and then it rolled off into the
darkness.</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>AN EXCHANGE OF COURTESIES</h3>


<p>"A narrow escape that for you,
Lieutenant," said Jones. "But she
was a plucky lass, and now it is time
for us to be looking for cover."</p>

<p>He turned down a narrow, quiet
street until we came to a house set
somewhat back in the yard.</p>

<p>Jones now rapped very gently on
the door; it swung open as if he was
expected, and a moment later we found
ourselves heartily welcomed by an old
Quaker lady in a little room with a
bright fire burning.</p>

<p>"I thought thee would come,
Brother Jones," said she, "and who
is this braw lad thou hast brought with
thee?" And she smiled on me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is one of our Lieutenants, who
has a sweetheart in town, and is willing
to risk his neck to see her," said Jones
gruffly, but there was a twinkle in his
eye.</p>

<p>This completed my conquest, and
the motherly old soul proceeded to
take charge of me.</p>

<p>"Who is thy lady love thou hast
come to see?" And when I told her
that she was a Tory she was much distressed,
but eager to help me.</p>

<p>"The Good Book says thou must
not fight, but it also says thou must
help thy friends and neighbours, so I
will help thee."</p>

<p>But at last, after chattering awhile
she took a candle and showed us to our
rooms. I was soon lost in the almost
blissful comfort of clean white sheets
and a feather-bed.</p>

<p>When I awoke next morning Jones
had already departed on his mission,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
leaving me a note telling me where to
meet him the next night on our return
to camp.</p>

<p>All that day I kept close to the
house, for I did not dare to venture
forth in the broad day, as I was known
to many, and it would not have gone
well with me if I had met with those
I knew.</p>

<p>But at last the night began to fall,
and, bidding my kind hostess good-bye,
I made my way through the streets to
the Tory's house.</p>

<p>I soon found it&mdash;a square brick
structure in a quiet street. I noticed,
as I approached it, several dark alleys
just at the right places for a rapid retreat
if the worse should come to the
worst.</p>

<p>Then my hand was on the knocker,
and its fall startled me as the clatter
echoed far down the street and seemed
to wake the very dead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>A slave opened the door, who,
though he glanced at me suspiciously,
told me that his mistress was at home.</p>

<p>Then in a moment my storm-coat
was off, and I stood in the door of the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful picture, the great
strong Highlander on his knees at the
feet of Mistress Jean begging for her
hand, which she seemed to be denying
him, for he was growing more and
more passionate.</p>

<p>For a moment, as I stood there, I
could feel my hair grow gray, but the
tumult and the conflict within me were
short and I turned to go, for it seemed
to me that she could not but care for
so gallant a gentleman.</p>

<p>But her eyes met mine, and then for
a moment there was terror in them,
and a cry broke forth from her lips.</p>

<p>Farquharson, startled by her gaze,
turned also, and, seeing me, was quickly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
on his feet, his face aflame with passion.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, advancing toward me,
"do you not know the fate of eavesdroppers"&mdash;and
then for the first
time noticing my uniform, added, "and
spies?"</p>

<p>"I know the fate of those who call
a gentleman by such names," I retorted
coolly.</p>

<p>"A gentleman?" and he laughed.
"I will have you hanged for a dog of
a spy before sunrise."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir, but you are my
prisoner until it shall suit me to let
you go free."</p>

<p>At this he laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"Well said, Sir Rebel," he cried;
"but permit me to pass before I spit
you on my sword." And he drew and
advanced upon me.</p>

<p>"Permit me, sir, to use another argument;"
and I drew my pistol and covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
him. "Advance another step and
I will blow your brains out."</p>

<p>He glanced at me for a moment, but
did not advance. "And further, let me
suggest that we are in the presence of
a lady, and it is not seemly for her to
see the flash of weapons."</p>

<p>At this he put up his sword.</p>

<p>"To whom do I owe a lesson in
gallantry?" he asked with a low and
sweeping bow.</p>

<p>"James Frisby, of Fairlee, a Lieutenant
in the Maryland Line," I replied
with equal courtesy.</p>

<p>Mistress Jean had stood as though
she were turned to stone during our
exchange of courtesies, but now she
seemed to recover.</p>

<p>"Captain Farquharson," she cried,
and she came and stood between us,
"this is an old friend of mine. He
saved my life at the Braes when we
were raided by the rebels. You must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
promise me to let him go free out of
the city."</p>

<p>"Your wishes, Mistress Jean, are
law," said he, "and shall be obeyed. I
shall give him till morning to escape in."</p>

<p>"Which I promptly accept," said I,
"with the hope that I may be able to
repay your courtesy if fortune should
bring you within our lines some day."</p>

<p>And so he bade Mistress Jean farewell,
but as he passed me, I whispered
to him:</p>

<p>"Sir, some words have been said that
need an explanation."</p>

<p>"It will give me pleasure to offer
you one at any place you may appoint."</p>

<p>"Then meet me," I said, "two days
hence at sunrise on the pike, half-way
between the lines."</p>

<p>"With swords or pistols?"</p>

<p>"Swords."</p>

<p>"I will be there;" and he passed on
out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>When he had gone, I turned to Mistress
Jean, who urged me to leave at
once.</p>

<p>"You must go," said she, "for at
any moment you may be tracked and
discovered, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;what?" I answered,
smiling. "Do you think, Mistress
Jean, that I, who travelled for miles
through the snow and the storm last
night to catch one glimpse of your face,
that I, who at last stand in your presence,
would give a thought to the noose
around my neck?"</p>

<p>But she would not let me say her
nay, and then her terror grew, until at
last she told me that Lord Howe sometimes
came home with her father at
nine o'clock to talk over the plans of
the spring campaign, and that every
moment she expected to hear their
voices in the hall.</p>

<p>"The sight of your face, Mistress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Jean, has repaid me for my journey;
but if you bid me go, why, then, it is
fate, and go I must." Then a thought
came to me. "Mistress Jean, tell me
this before I leave in the enemy's camp
all that is dearest on earth to me: tell
me if you love that Highlander, if you
care for him." And she, who a moment
before was urging me to leave,
stood silent, with her face turned away
from me, with never a word to say.</p>

<p>And I, seeing how matters stood,
took my courage in my hands, and,
with a low bow, wished her good-bye.</p>

<h3>THE CROSSING OF SWORDS</h3>


<p>Sunrise, two days later, found Mr.
Richard Ringgold and myself stamping
our feet in the snow on the pike, half-way
between the hostile lines.</p>

<p>"I suppose they will let us fight here
without interruption," said Dick.</p>

<p>"No danger from that," I replied.
"We will fight in that little hollow,
where the outposts cannot see us."</p>

<p>"Here they come," said Dick. We
saw two officers approaching across the
snow from the Highland outpost.</p>

<p>They soon came up, and we saluted,
while Dick and Captain Forbes, Farquharson's
second, soon agreed upon
the preliminaries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you lead the way, gentlemen?"
said Forbes.</p>

<p>Dick and I led them to the little
hollow between the hills, where a slight
meadow formed a platform, as it were,
for us to act our drama upon.</p>

<p>Since my first duel with Rodolph on
the banks of the Elk I had seen something
of war and of battles, and considered
myself an old hand in such
encounters.</p>

<p>And so I found myself looking
Farquharson over and estimating his
strength and his skill, for I knew him
to be one of the best swordsmen among
the Highlanders, while I could claim,
with all due modesty, to be the best in
the Maryland Line.</p>

<p>He was a notable swordsman, you
could see that at a glance; the powerful
figure, yet as light and active as a
cat, the muscles of his sword arm
telling of long and patient handling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of the weapon, while his cold gray
eye spoke for his coolness and determination.</p>

<p>He glanced at me, as we threw off
our coats, in almost an indifferent manner,
as if he had a duty to perform,
which was to be done as quickly as possible,
the mere suppression of a country
bumpkin by a gentleman of fashion. I
knew that would change as soon as our
swords crossed, and smiled to myself.
Then, being stripped to our shirts, we
took our places and saluted.</p>

<p>Click, and our swords rang true.
Though he fenced somewhat carelessly
at first, there came a surprised look
and a sudden change in his manner, as
I parried a skilful thrust and touched
him lightly on the shoulder. He
seemed to realise that he had no ordinary
swordsman opposed to him, and
quickly brought into play all his skill
and fierceness in attack, throwing me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
on the defensive and forcing me gradually
back.</p>

<p>It could not last; no strength could
stand it. When he found that the
steel guard met every attack, that every
thrust was parried, he relaxed the fierceness
of his attack and began to fence
with more skill and caution.</p>

<p>Thus it was we fenced for several
minutes, the clash of the steel ringing
out in the cold, crisp air across the
snow, and it came to my opponent that
he had at last met a swordsman who
was his equal in skill. From this on
every moment he developed some new
feint, some new attack, and, though I
met them every one, it took my utmost
skill to do so.</p>

<p>But at last there came the end. He
had assumed the offensive again and
was pressing hard upon me, when he
placed his foot upon a loose stone in
the snow, which rolled. The sword<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
flew from out his hand and he was
down upon his knee.</p>

<p>My sword was at his throat, and
then my hand was stayed, for there
came before me the vision of the Tory
maid, standing with face averted in the
square brick house in the city. That
she might care, that she might be in
terror then as to the fate that might
befall him, flashed through my brain.
I brought my sword to a salute, and
returned it to its scabbard.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, as Farquharson rose,
"it is a pleasure to have fought with so
gallant a gentleman."</p>

<p>"And I, sir," he returned, "am
happy to have met so skilful a
swordsman." And then, like gallant
men who have fought and know each
other's worth, we shook hands on
the spot where a moment before our
blades were thirsting for each other's
blood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"It gives me pleasure," he continued,
"to withdraw my remarks at
Colonel Gordon's, as they arose from
a misapprehension."</p>

<p>"I will consider them as if they had
never been said," I replied, "and I
beg of you, on your return, to present
my compliments to Mistress Gordon,
and tell her that I send you to her as
my wedding gift."</p>

<p>"Why, is she to be married?" he
asked in a startled way.</p>

<p>"I believe so," I answered, "but she
will tell you all about it."</p>

<p>And so we returned to the pike,
where we all saluted again, and retraced
our steps to the lines.</p>

<p>The spring was late that year. April
had come before there came a soft
warm breeze from the Southland, waking
nature into life, and covering the
hard frozen face of mother earth
with wreaths and clouds of mist and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
moisture. From every hillside, from
every frost-bound plain, the smoke of
spring arose, and through the air there
breathed the spirit of the reincarnated
life of the world.</p>

<p>How we of the Southland hailed it
with joy, and drank in with our lungs
this promise of a new life! We who
loved the sunshine and the balmy
breezes, the great joy of living amid
fragrant fields and green-clad forests,
we who hated the storms, the wind
and cold of the North,&mdash;ah, how the
blood in our veins welcomed this soft
caress of the South! We threw off
the terror of the winter, looked forward
with glee to the opening of the spring
campaign, and counted in anticipation
the honours we were to win, the glory
that would be ours.</p>

<p>New life sprang up all through the
camp; the troops left the busy duty
of hugging the fires, the ranks filled up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
and order and discipline once more became
the order of the day.</p>

<p>Rumours soon came creeping through
the lines of a change in the leadership
of the enemy's forces, but as yet they
lay quietly within the city and showed
not the teeth of offence. Thus we lay
on the green hillsides of Valley Forge,
busily preparing for the struggle which
was certain to come, until far into the
spring, without a sign of a movement
on the part of the enemy.</p>

<p>But with May came their new Commander-in-Chief,
Sir Henry Clinton,
and the departure of Lord Howe, and
we knew that the time had at last come
when some bold stroke would be
played in the game of war.</p>

<p>The gaps in our ranks had been
somewhat filled, and we were ready
and eager for active service as soon
as the great General would give the
command.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>At last came rumours of a retreat,
that the English were preparing to desert
the city and march across the plains
of Jersey to where New York lay, sheltered
by the waters of the sea and the
rivers. We marched toward the Delaware
to be ready to strike them when
they moved.</p>

<p>So, one day, as I stood on the outpost,
guarding the nearest road to the
city, I saw Jones approaching at full
speed on an old horse, which he had
evidently borrowed. I was ready for
his news.</p>

<p>"The British are crossing the Delaware;
we will catch them in Jersey
now or never," he cried, and then
he had dashed past on his way to headquarters.</p>

<p>My little guard received the news
with a yell, and we looked forward
eagerly for the order to join our regiment
on the march.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long in coming, and on
that night, the 18th of June, we crossed
the Delaware, and started on the race
across Jersey that was to end at
Monmouth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE SANDS OF MONMOUTH</h3>


<p>For a week we hung on the flank of
the enemy, waiting for an opportunity
to strike, as we saw the immense train
form on the right bank of the Delaware
and take up its cumbersome march
across the Jersey plains.</p>

<p>With it marched the whole force of
the British army of seventeen thousand
men, who did their duty so well that we
longed for an opening in vain.</p>

<p>All through those blazing hot
days of June we marched through the
sands of Jersey, ankle deep as we
trudged along, and it seemed as if the
time for a trial of strength would never
come. All to the east and south of us
the great train of their wagons crawled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
along through the heat and the dust,
and the sun glinted and gleamed on the
points of the bayonets as the mass of
their troops marched on.</p>

<p>Slowly they crawled through the
dusty roads of Jersey, and slowly they
were crawling beyond the reach of our
arms into the haven of safety.</p>

<p>At last, on the 27th of the month,
they reached the heights of Monmouth,
within a day's march of their
journey's end, while we lay five miles
away at Englishtown, swearing low and
earnestly at our luck.</p>

<p>That night there came news to the
camp that put new life in the men, and
made them forget the heat and the toil
of the march; the news that the great
General had decided to risk a throw in
the morning, and that our regiment was
to be with the advance.</p>

<p>And so, when Lee rode up to take
command, we gave him a cheer, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
though we disliked and distrusted the
man, yet his coming meant a fight in
the morning.</p>

<p>Then there was a great stir in the
camp; the men saw to their muskets,
and the signs everywhere told of their
eager preparations for the deadly
struggle in the morning, while the
cheery laugh and the snatches of song
spoke well for the spirits of the men after
the long, toilsome march of the day.</p>

<p>The sun comes up out of the ocean
early in Jersey, but even before its rays
had cleared the pine tops our camp
was stirring with life, the men preparing
for the advance.</p>

<p>But there seemed to be a fatality
about it all; a hand, as it were, covered
us and held us back, paralyzing the
spirit of the men. Delay followed
delay, and when at last the regiments
took up the line of march, ours was
held back until almost the last. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
New Jersey volunteers had the post of
honour, as they longed to revenge their
ruined homesteads and devastated farms,
and then our turn came.</p>

<p>We marched out of Englishtown
into the dreary country beyond. On
every side sand dunes, former barriers
of the ocean, raised their crests, covered
with a straggling forest of stunted pines
and scrub trees, which, in the passes in
the hills, came down to the road, disputing
the passageway, while in the
shallow valleys lay the open fields and
marshes. A dreary country withal,
but where a small body of troops could
hold the passes in the hills against
many hundreds and make good their
defence.</p>

<p>We passed through the defile in the
first range of hills, crossed the low
valley, and then, after passing through
the second defile, we had only to cross
the one before us to be on the heights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
overlooking the enemy's position at
Freehold.</p>

<p>As we approached this last pass in
the hills we were surprised to see a
steady stream of our troops coming
back in disorder through the gap.
The men were retreating doggedly in
broken ranks, and turning, as they
trudged along, to look back, as if with
half a mind to return.</p>

<p>As they came streaming past our
advance I called to a sergeant, an old
backwoodsman whose courage I knew,
and asked him of the battle and why
he was not fighting.</p>

<p>"Fight?" he cried indignantly,
"why, damn it, Lieutenant, they will
not let us fight. They ordered us to
retreat before a musket was fired."</p>

<p>At that moment Captain Mercer, an
aide of the staff of General Lee, rode up
to Colonel Ramsay, who was near me.</p>

<p>He delivered an order rapidly, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
then I heard Ramsay's voice ring out
angrily. "Retreat?" he cried. "By
whose order?"</p>

<p>"By the order of General Lee."</p>

<p>"But," he protested hotly, "we have
not seen the enemy yet."</p>

<p>Mercer shrugged his shoulders. "I
only carry the order," he said.</p>

<p>The stream of fugitives grew rapidly,
becoming more disorderly, showing at
every step the spread of the panic and
the rout, as Colonel Ramsay stopped the
advance and gave the order to retreat.</p>

<p>Slowly and reluctantly we obeyed,
and as we retired through the second
pass in the hills we saw the British gain
the opposite ridge and advance with
cheers on the disorderly flying mass in
the sandy valley behind.</p>

<p>Every moment the press of the fugitives
grew greater, and though we still
maintained our formation and marched
as on parade the retreat had turned into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
a rout. On every side and in our rear
the broken ranks of the army poured
past, demoralised and in despair, and
ever nearer came the musketry and the
cheers of the advancing English.</p>

<p>"They will catch us before we get
through the gap," said Dick, looking
at the pass in front of us.</p>

<p>"Then we will fight anyhow," I
replied, "and General Lee can go to
the devil."</p>

<p>Whereupon our spirits began to pick
up, and the men retreated more slowly
than ever, glancing over their shoulders
to see how near the head of the British
column was.</p>

<p>At last we came to the foot of
the first pass, with its hills heavily
covered with scrub pines. Behind us
stretched the fields of broken troops, and
we could see the red line of the British
as they debouched upon the plain
and drove the patriots before them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a wild scene of confusion and
disorder, of demoralised retreat and
rout; and then something happened.</p>

<p>There was a stir in the pass in our
front, a clatter of hoofs, and there
appeared before us the General with
his staff. He towered there with his
great figure, a veritable god of war and
of wrath.</p>

<p>For a moment his eye swept the
field, and his face flushed crimson with
indignation and anger, as he saw the
best troops of his army flying like
sheep before the enemy. There was
a storm in the air, and then, as Lee
rode up, it broke.</p>

<p>We heard his excited "Sir, sir!"
and the General's angry tones, and
then dismissing him contemptuously,
he called to Hamilton to ask if there
was a regiment which could stop the
advance.</p>

<p>Ramsay sprang forward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"My regiment is ready, General."</p>

<p>"If you stop them ten minutes until
I form, you will save the army."</p>

<p>"I will stop them or fall," cried
Ramsay, and, turning to us, he gave
the order to "About face," and then
crying that the General relied on us
to save the army, he led us in the
charge.</p>

<p>Not a moment too soon, for, as the
press of the fugitives was brushed aside
by our advance, mingling in the midst
of the disorderly mass, came the red line
of the British, cheering and victorious.</p>

<p>But suddenly the flying mass disappeared,
and in their place came the
yell of the Maryland Line, the long
array of their bayonets bent to the
charge, with all the fury and weight of
their onset.</p>

<p>For a moment the red line hesitated;
then an officer, who looked strangely
familiar, sprang forward, shouting:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are nothing but dogs of
rebels; charge and break them."</p>

<p>The red line answered with a cheer,
for their fighting blood was up, and
they dashed forward to meet us.</p>

<p>Then came such a clash of steel as is
seldom heard, as the King's Grenadiers
and the Maryland Line met in the
shock of the charge. For a moment
so close was the press that we could
not wield our arms, and men fell,
spitted on each other's bayonets.</p>

<p>Then came a deadly struggle, as men
fought desperately, hand to hand, and
the lines swayed backward and forward
as the weight of the numbers told.
The ground was lost and gained, struggled
for and won over and over, while
the dead lay in heaps under our feet.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of this deadly
struggle, when I was fighting sword in
hand amid the press of bayonets for
my very life, that I saw Ramsay, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
was near, cheering on his men, come
face to face with the officer who led the
charge of the Grenadiers. Then, in
that storm centre, around which the
roar of battle raged, there was a flash
of steel and the swords crossed. But
in the fury of the battle duels are short
and fierce, and I saw Ramsay, who was
already covered with wounds, falter for
a moment, as the other lunged, and
then he was down among the slain.</p>

<p>Our line hesitated as Ramsay fell,
and the English pressed on with a
cheer. But I sprang forward, shouting
to the men to save their Colonel, and
they, answering my call, forced the
English back, until I stood by Ramsay's
body. But only for a moment;
before we could raise Ramsay gently
up and bear him off the field, there
came another charge of the Grenadiers
that forced us off our feet and hurled
us backward, fighting desperately, leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the body of our Colonel in the
hands of the enemy. But in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>
I found my sword crossing that of the
officer who had fought with Ramsay,
and instantly I attacked him fiercely,
for I was burning to avenge Ramsay's
fall. But he, with ease and coolness,
parried all my thrusts and played with
me as if I were but a child. Then, as
I was growing desperate, he called to me,
"Nay, lad, go try your sword on some
one else and leave an old Scot alone.
I would not hurt you for the world."</p>

<p>I started and let the point of my
sword fall, for it was the voice of the
old Tory, whom I had not before recognised
in the confusion of the fight.
This slight hesitation almost led to my
capture, for I had been fighting in advance
of our line, and now I found
myself in the midst of the English
troops. So, saluting the old Tory
hastily, I regained our lines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, fighting foot by foot and inch,
by inch, we contested their advance, as
the weight of numbers bore us backward
up the hill into the pines. But
every minute gained meant the salvation
of the army.</p>

<p>Ah, it was hot work there, ankle
deep in the sand, with the broiling sun
above us, while the smoke and the dust
of the conflict filled our throats and
eyes; but we staggered on and fought
blindly, desperately, amid the din and
the carnage.</p>

<p>Ten minutes, twenty minutes&mdash;ah,
there it is at last, and the roar of the
opening battle broke out to the right
and left of us, as the re-formed regiments
went into the fight.</p>

<p>Then to our left came the high piercing
yell of our brothers of the Line, and
we knew that the British were falling
back before them. The Grenadiers
struggled on for a moment longer, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the force of their charge was spent, and
the fire of the new regiments forced
them back in turn.</p>

<p>But it was only for awhile, for they
re-formed, and, under the leadership
of the gallant Monkton, hurled themselves
upon us once again.</p>

<p>Monkton fell, and their lines shrivelled
up under our fire. Then, as it
was near the setting of the sun, Washington,
glancing over the field, saw that
the time had come and ordered the
advance.</p>

<p>Our whole line sprang forward, and,
though we had borne the brunt, the toil,
and heat of the day, not a man faltered.
As the long line swept forward the
British slowly retreated before us. We
drove them across the plain and through
the second pass, where night overtook
us and stopped our pursuit.</p>

<p>But then, when the fever of the
battle left us, a great fatigue seized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
hold of our limbs, the men sank to the
earth as they stood, and slept from very
exhaustion.</p>

<p>But we were soon to be aroused.</p>

<p>Through the darkness came the
sound of a horse's hoofs, and a voice,
asking for Ramsay's regiment. I sprang
up, answering, and saw approaching a
body of horsemen. The foremost rider
seemed an immense figure, as he advanced
in the darkness; but I, who had
seen him often before, knew him to be
the great General.</p>

<p>I immediately gave the alarm, and
the men sprang to their feet and presented
arms.</p>

<p>And then, there under the pines, by
the light of the stars, the General rode
down our line, and, coming to the
centre, we felt his glance fall over our
ranks.</p>

<p>"Men of Maryland," spoke Washington,
and his voice rang clear through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the pines, "once before at Long Island
you saved the army, and to-day, for a
second time, you have done so by your
courage and tenacity. I thank you in
the name of the army and the nation;
I thank you for myself."</p>

<p>A wild yell that broke from the Line
was his answer. We forgot our fatigue
and our wounds in the pride of the
moment.</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>IN THE LINES OF THE ENEMY</h3>


<p>It was near the end of the first watch
when an order came to me to pick out
several men, go forward, feel the enemy's
outposts, and see if the enemy
was still retreating.</p>

<p>Making my choice, I passed our
pickets with three men, and made my
way cautiously to the last pass in the
hills which was in the enemy's possession
at nightfall. But not a sign of
their pickets or troops could I find; so
I boldly advanced in the pass, and,
crossing the ridge, found myself on the
heights overlooking Freehold. It was
a small town of scattered houses, and
beyond it I could see the lights of the
British camp-fires.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>But as the heights were not near
enough for our purpose, we descended
into the plain, and carefully made our
way toward the town, where I knew
certain patriots were, who, if I could
once get speech with them, would tell
me the whole plans of the enemy.</p>

<p>We could hear the tramp of feet at
the further side of the village, and all
the sounds of an army in retreat. Being
now so close to them, and in great
danger, we moved with the utmost caution.
Near at hand, on the outskirts
of the town, stood a large, square stone
house, separated from the rest of the
houses by an immense garden. Having
found a break in the hedge, we entered.</p>

<p>It was an old garden, filled with boxwood
walks and flowers run wild. Very
prim at one time it must have been;
but, now that the war had helped the
return to nature, it was a wild and
tangled mass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Making our way through the garden,
a light was suddenly thrown upon our
path, and, glancing up, I saw that it
came from a window which, though it
was on the first floor of the house, was
yet some distance from the ground.</p>

<p>Then the figure of a woman crossed
the window, stopping for a moment to
look out, while we stood in the shadow
of the hedge, holding our breath. But
she passed on, and I, determining to
see into the room to discover whether
it contained friend or foe, quickly
gained the shelter of the wall of the
house. The wall was of rough hewn
stone, and with the help of my comrades'
shoulders, I raised myself high
enough to glance over the window-sill,
and what I saw there made me drop to
the ground quickly.</p>

<p>Then, whispering to my comrades to
stay where they were, I made my way
to the rear entrance of the house, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
finding the door unfastened, softly entered
the hall; and then I was standing
in the door of the room from which the
light came.</p>

<p>A lamp stood on a table near a long
horse-hair sofa with spindle legs, on
which lay the figure of a man. The
coat had been cut from his shoulder,
which was swathed in many bandages,
while the blood-stained rags on the
table and the floor told of the seriousness
of the wound.</p>

<p>A slender figure was bending over
him, gently arranging a pillow under
his head.</p>

<p>"Do you feel easier now, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lassie." Then, a moment
later, "Why does not Clinton send me
a carriage? He surely does not intend
to desert me here."</p>

<p>"Captain Farquharson is searching
for one," she answered. And then
turning to the table, she saw me standing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
in the doorway. The colour left her
face; she gave a little cry, for she
thought there were many men behind
me, and that all was lost. So, quickly
putting my finger to my lips, I stepped
back into the darkness of the hall, and
as I did so, I heard the old Tory ask,
"What's that?"</p>

<p>"It was nothing," she answered. "I
thought I saw a ghost."</p>

<p>I stood there in the broad window
waiting, for I knew she would come.</p>

<p>Below me was the garden, heavy-scented
with the odour of flowers, and
the hum of the night insects was everywhere
in the air. Close to the wall I
saw the figures of my scouts. The
noise of the tramp of feet, the creak of
waggons, and the voice of command
came to me from the village street.</p>

<p>At last she came and stood before
me. In her eyes were great pain and
fear and suffering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me," she asked anxiously,
"is there any danger for him?"</p>

<p>"More danger for me than for him,"
I replied. "The whole American advance
guard consists of three men and myself;
the rest will follow in the morning."</p>

<p>"Ah," she cried, and there was hope
once more in her voice; "then we can
escape."</p>

<p>"If you can move your father by
sunrise, yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"But you," she said, and there was
new anxiety in her voice; "you are in
great danger here. When the soldiers
come to remove father they will take
you prisoner."</p>

<p>"I care not, Mistress Jean," I answered,
"for your eyes have held me
prisoner for many a long day, and all
the prison bars in the world are nothing
to me so long as I can look into them."</p>

<p>"Nay," she said, "you must not
say such things to me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>And I, taking this as a confirmation
of all my fears and that at last Farquharson
had succeeded in his suit, would
have bade her good-bye and gone my
way. But before I went I told her of
my wishes for her happiness, and that
I had met Farquharson and knew of
his skill and courage.</p>

<p>"Farquharson?" and her eyes were
wide open in surprise. "I really believe
you think I am going to marry
him;" and she laughed so softly, bewitchingly,
that&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jean, Jean," I cried, now that hope
and life had come back with a rush,
"Jean, do you know that I love you;
that I love the very ground on which
you walk, the sunbeams in your hair,
the very air you breathe? Ah! Jean&mdash;"
But at that moment came the voice of
the Tory calling her and the tramp of
feet on the porch.</p>

<p>"Let me go," she cried, for I held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
her hands in mine; "and fly,&mdash;that is
the guard."</p>

<p>"Nay," said I, "not till you give
me a kiss. I will stay here and be
captured first."</p>

<p>There was a moment's hesitation,
and then a flash of white arms, and the
softest caress&mdash;ah, such a caress that
the memory of it will go with me to
the grave. And then she was gone.</p>

<p>And I, not wishing to be captured
now, slipped through the rear door to
my men, and a short time later, having
satisfied ourselves of the retreat of the
enemy's forces, we made our way back
over the hills to report to the General.</p>

<p>We followed the enemy closely the
next day, and did not draw off until we
saw them beyond our reach at Sandy
Hook.</p>

<p>Then we took our way to the Jersey
hills, and lay there for a time watching
the enemy in New York.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>THE PASSING OF YEARS</h3>


<p>Then came a long period when it
seemed almost as if peace had settled
over the land, so seldom did the rattle
of musket fire or the angry flash of
guns break the quiet repose of the
Jersey plains and farms.</p>

<p>Far across the marshes lay New
York, and behind its walls and the
broad sweep of the waters the British
army rested safe, while the army of the
patriots, scattered among the forests,
woods, and hills of Jersey and New
York, lived, like Robin Hood's followers
of old, and waited while the wheel
of fortune turned.</p>

<p>A year went by, when at the taking
of Paulus Hook I first heard news<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
of the welfare of the Tory and the
maid, since the night of the Monmouth
retreat.</p>

<p>It was after an all-night march through
the marshes of Jersey, often breast-high
in the water, that we made a silent,
deadly charge with the bayonet on the
enemy's fort, and carried it before the
sun had risen.</p>

<p>We were retiring rapidly, after securing
our prisoners, when one of my men
called to me: "Captain, here's one
of those Highland chiefs knocked on
the head."</p>

<p>I went to him and found that it was
Farquharson, who had received an ugly
blow on the head from a clubbed
musket.</p>

<p>A little whiskey between his teeth
and water on his face revived him, and
I was able, with the help of several
men, to carry him along with our
party.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>We made good our retreat, and when
several days later I was in the main
camp of the army, I went to the quarters
where the prisoners were detained,
and there I again met Farquharson.</p>

<p>"Captain," said he, smiling, for he
had almost recovered from his wound,
"there is no entering a contest against
you; fortune is always on your side."</p>

<p>"My turn will come," I answered;
"but is there anything I can do for
you?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid not, unless you bribe
the guards to let me escape."</p>

<p>"That would be clear against the
articles of war," I replied. We fell to
talking, and then it was I heard of the
Tory and his daughter.</p>

<p>"It was about Christmas time," said
Farquharson, "that the King sent a
message over the sea, granting him a
pardon for the part he had taken in
'45, for you know he was out then.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
The Sea Raven was about to clear in a
week for Glasgow, and a sudden longing
seemed to seize him to see once
more the dash of the waters through
the Braes of Mar and the heather-crowned
hills of old Aberdeen; and so,
within a week, they had sailed away;
and as he left he said to me: 'A
revolt drove me from old Scotland;
another sends me back again. I wonder
where fortune will end my days.'
It is a strange fortune that has followed
him through life."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed," I replied.</p>

<p>So they sailed away over the seas,
gone back to their own land and
people; and between that land and
mine burned high the flame of war.
But through the flame and across the
broad stretch of the waters, I saw the
form of the maid beckoning me on,
and though my hope was well-nigh
gone, I buckled tight my sword-belt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
and doggedly went on,&mdash;went on,
through the long march to the southward,
the toil, the hunger, and the
defeat of the Camden campaign.</p>

<p>The great triumph of Eutaw Springs
and Cowpens, as we drove back Cornwallis
from the hill country to the
shore, rolled back the tide of invasion
and drowned it in the sea.</p>

<p>A year went by, bringing me adventures
not a few, and with the adventures
came wounds and honours; and
when there came the news of the
leaguer of Yorktown, it found me a
full Colonel in the army of the South.</p>

<p>It was not my fortune to be present
at that last great feat of our arms, when
the great General struck the blow that
freed us for ever from the tyranny of
the King.</p>

<p>But when the news came down to
us in the savannahs of the South we
hailed it with joy, for we saw once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
more before us the quiet, smiling fields
of Maryland, with the ease and comfort
and plenty of it all that awaited
but our coming to repay us for the
years of strife and blood.</p>

<p>And then at last came the order for
us to take up the homeward march.
The men took up the trail with as
jaunty a step as when they first
marched to the northward, long years
before. The gay uniforms were faded
and gone; rags and tatters had taken
their places, while of the brave banner
that was flung to the breeze at the
Head of Elk nothing remained but
the staff and a few ribbons that flaunted
therefrom.</p>

<p>But every tatter told the tale of a
fight where the shot and shell had torn
it as it waved above the charging line,
the deadly struggle of the hand to
hand, or marked the slow and sullen
retreat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>The men themselves were hardy and
bronzed; from their ragged caps to
their soleless shoes they bore the stamp
of veterans. They showed the signs of
their training in the angry school of war;
wide indeed was the difference between
the gay volunteers of '76 and the hardy
veterans of '82. We swung along in
our homeward march with a right goodwill,
and at last came to the broad
Potomac and saw the hills of Maryland
beyond.</p>

<p>Now the river itself to the low water-line
of the southern bank is within the
boundaries of Maryland. Wishing to
be the first across the line, I rode my
horse in to the saddle-girths, and let
him drink thereof.</p>

<p>A day later brought us to Annapolis,
where we received the thanks of the
State authorities, and with all due form
and ceremony obtained our discharge
and then dispersed to our homes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>That very day I took a canoe, and,
crossing the bay, found myself again on
the steps of Fairlee.</p>

<p>Once more my mother leaned on my
arm, and, looking up at her tall, broad-shouldered
son, with his epaulets of a
Colonel, bronzed face, and hardy bearing,
seemed proud and happy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>THE COMING OF THE MAID</h3>


<p>Many months had passed away,
spring had come again, and the fair city
of Annapolis lay in a mass of flowers.
The vivid green of the old trees cast a
delightful shade over all, tempting one
to stroll through the quiet streets and
byways, past the moss-grown walls, the
old-fashioned gardens, buried in roses,
and the stately, proud mansions of many
of Maryland's best and bravest.</p>

<p>I was standing on a step and above
me stood Mistresses Polly and Betsy
Johnson, who were railing at me now
that I no longer wore a uniform and
was simply a plain member of the
Legislature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"He looked so fine in his brass
buttons," said Mistress Polly.</p>

<p>"A brave, bold, quite proper-looking
young fellow," added Mistress
Betsy.</p>

<p>"And now just look at him," continued
Mistress Polly pathetically; and
they surveyed me sorrowfully, while
malicious mischief played around the
corners of their eyes.</p>

<p>I laughed outright. I could not help
it, so droll was the expression on their
faces.</p>

<p>"True, your ladyship," I said; "the
toga does not fit a young man so well
as the buckled sabre and glittering
epaulets. But now that dull peace has
come, the hall of the Legislature is the
only place where you can throw the
weight of your sword in the conflict and
wield some influence in the great struggles
of the country; would you have
me idle?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, I would not have that," said
Mistress Polly judiciously. "But your
round head and big hands are just the
things for a fight, and though your
voice is&mdash;well&mdash;can be heard a considerable
distance, I am afraid&mdash;&mdash;"
She paused, as if doubtful about its being
put to any good use in the hall of
the Assembly.</p>

<p>Decidedly I was getting the worst
of it.</p>

<p>At this moment Dick Ringgold, who
represented Kent with me, came swinging
up the street, and, seeing me standing
on the steps, hailed me with&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hello, Frisby, have you heard the
news?"</p>

<p>"What news?"</p>

<p>"Your old Tory friend Gordon is
on the Sally Ann, from London, which
has just come up the harbour."</p>

<p>"Any one with him?" I asked
anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Dick, maliciously drawling
it out, "I heard some one say there
was a young lady with him."</p>

<p>I did not stop to protest against the
laughter that followed me as I dashed
down the street, or to Dick's shout as
he called something after me. A few
minutes later I was on the wharf.</p>

<p>Out in the stream, swaying with
the current of the tide, lay the Sally
Ann, her tall spars tapering high in air,
her decks full of bustle and activity,
showing the journey's end and that the
final preparations for disembarkation
were under full headway.</p>

<p>As I arrived a boat was pulling off
from her side containing two passengers.
As I saw them my heart gave a great
bound; my hand went to my hat and
swung it around my head. In answer
to my signal came the fluttering of a
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, as the old Tory stepped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
ashore, "let me be the first to welcome
you back to old Maryland."</p>

<p>"Would that all my enemies were
like you!" he replied. "I hesitated
long about returning, but Jean would
have it so."</p>

<p>And Mistress Jean said not a word
as I took her hand in mine, but her
face was mantled in scarlet and her eyes
were downcast.</p>

<p>The prim old garden of the Nicholsons
never looked more charming, the
flowers more sweet and beautiful, or the
green boxwood hedges more suggestive
of rest and repose; the lazy waters of
the Chester rolled along at its foot,
gently lapping the grass. Ah! the sun
was shining on a glorious world that
day, for Mistress Jean walked beside
me.</p>

<p>"Mistress Jean," said I, as we stood
where the waters met the grass and
looked out over the broad and silent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
river, flowing on and on as if to eternity,
"our lives have been more like mountain
torrents than the broad smooth
river here. We have lived through
the battles and sieges, seen blood and
death and all the horrors of a great war,
but now that peace has come, and our
course lies through pleasant fields and
verdant meadows, would it not be best
for them to join and flow on as this
great river does, Jean? Ah, Jean, you
know how much I love you."</p>

<p>And then she placed her hand in
mine; her eyes spoke that which I
most wished to know, and the very
earth seemed glorious.</p>

<p>I know not how long we stood
there, when there came Mistress Nancy
Nicholson's voice through the garden,
calling, "Jean, Jean, where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here," she answered; and with that
Mistress Nancy came running round
the hedge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Jean," she cried, "Dick has
proposed."</p>

<p>And then, seeing me, she stamped
her little foot, and cried, "Oh, bother!"
blushing meanwhile as red as one of her
roses.</p>

<p>"And so have I, Mistress Nancy,"
I replied.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And now, my children, I end this
tale, sitting here on the old porch at
Fairlee. The pen drops from my hand,
but my eyes are not too dim to see
the flash of the sunlight on the waters
of the great bay through the break in
the trees.</p>

<p>Nor are they too dim, Miss Jean, in
spite of the impertinent toss of your
head, to see in you the likeness of the
maid that led me such a wild dance in
the days of my youth. And I promise
you, if you do not smile on young
Dick Ringgold and stop your <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>outrageous
treatment of him, I will not
leave you a cent in my will.</p>

<p>There, there; I retract every word
that I said. Was there ever so audacious
a monkey in the world?</p>

<p>There, I have finished. Oh, yes, I
forgot&mdash;</p>

<p>"John Cotton, bring me some more
mint."</p>
